Firstly, I would like to thank Karim Malik for all his help and guidance in the past four years. 
I am also grateful to my collaborators Adam Christopherson and Ian Huston. I would like
to thank the rest of the QMUL cosmology group for their support and guidance and for being there
when a pint is what's needed, in particular David Mulryne and Tim Clifton. I would like to also thank
all my office mates and fellow students at Queen Mary, especially Alex Leithes and Joe Elliston, for
making QMUL such a fun place to study. 
 
I would like to thank my flat mates in London, Becs, Pip and Garnet who have been there for me outside of
work and made living in London so enjoyable. I am also very grateful to my parents, my other siblings, Alex and Will,
and the rest of my family for their encouragement and support over the last few years.
Finally, I owe so many thanks to Andrew, I would not have made it through the last four years, especially the last
month or two, without the support, love and belief you constantly provide me. Thank you so much!
