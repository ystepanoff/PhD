In this chapter we will be introducing the curvature perturbation.
We will start by discussing how we can generate seeds for the structure in the universe 
using quantum fluctuations during inflation. We will then introduce conserved quantities, such as the
curvature perturbation. Finally we will solve the evolution equations for the perturbation of the scalar field 
numerically in order to evaluate the evolution of the curvature perturbation.
This will allow us to give a detailed account of the behaviour of the curvature perturbation close to
horizon crossing. Large sections of this chapter are published in the papers Ref.~\cite{Nalson:2011gc,Nalson:2013tm}.

\section{Producing perturbations during inflation}
\label{introduction}



\subsection{Quantum produced fluctuations}
\label{Quantum}

In Section~\ref{Inflation} we mentioned that it was possible to generate the seeds for the structure we see today by quantum fluctuation during a period of
inflation. In this section we will be formulating this mathematically and explaining how the quantum fluctuations 
in the very early universe lead to perturbations in the energy density at later times. 

Starting from the Klein-Gordon equation, Eq.~(\ref{KGeq1st}) and working in flat gauge we make the change of variables $u = a \delta \vp_1 $ and $z = \frac{a \vp_0'}{\H}$.
If we re-write the resulting equation in Fourier space then we arrive at the Mukhanov equation,  
\be
\label{Mukhanov}
u''(k^i) + \left( k^2 - \frac{z''}{z} \right) u(k^i) = 0 \,.
\ee

If we wish to study what happens at a quantum level we will need to quantise this equation; in Minkowski space this
is straight forward, we do it by promoting $u$ and $u'$ to operators \cite{Mukhanov:2005sc},
\be
u(k^i) \to \hat{u}(k^i) \,, \quad u'(k^i) \to \hat{u'}(k^i) \,.
\ee
 Working in the Heisenberg picture we can expand the operator $\hat{u}$ in terms of the standard creation and 
annihilation operators ($\hat{a}$ and $\hat{a}^{\dagger}$ ),     
\be
\label{uDec}
\hat{u}(k^i) = \omega (k^i) \hat{a}(k^i) + \omega^* (- k^i) \hat{a}^{\dagger}(- k^i) \,,
\ee
where $\omega$, the mode function, also satisfies the Mukhanov equation, 
\be
\label{Muk}
\omega''(k^i) + \left( k^2 - \frac{z''}{z} \right) \omega(k^i) = 0 \,.
\ee

In order to solve this equation we require two boundary conditions. 
The first is given by imposing the canonical commutator on our operators,
\be
[\hat{u}, \hat{u}' ] = i \,, %\hbar \,,
\ee
which leads to the following normalisation condition for the mode function \cite{Mukhanov:2005sc}, 
\be
\label{normal}
\omega^* (k^i) \omega'(k^i) - {\omega^*}' (k^i) \omega(k^i) = - i \,. %\hbar  \,. %% Check the hbar factor???
\ee

The second boundary condition comes from our choice of vacuum. 
There is not a unique choice for the vacuum state \cite{Birrell:1982ix, Unruh:1976db, Kinney:2009vz},
so we pick the most natural choice which is the Minkowski vacuum. 
This is the vacuum state seen by a comoving observer in the far past when 
$\eta \to - \infty $  % Ref Liddle and lyth, kinney & Baumann TASI lectures 
and all modes are much smaller than the Hubble radius,
%We only need consider a small spacetime patch, which can be assumed flat.   
and is known as the Bunch-Davies vacuum \cite{Birrell:1982ix, Kinney:2009vz}. 

In the limit $\eta \to - \infty $ Eq.~(\ref{Muk}) becomes
\be
\omega''(k^i) +  k^2  \omega (k^i) = 0 \,,
\ee
which leads to the following solution
\be
\omega = Ae^{-ik\eta} + Be^{ik\eta} \,.
\ee
In the limit $\eta \to -\infty$ the first term dominates and the solution becomes 
\be
\omega = Ae^{-ik\eta} \,.
\label{infsol}
\ee

Applying the first boundary condition in Eq.~(\ref{normal}) 
to the solution in Eq.~(\ref{infsol}) we find that $A = 1/\sqrt{2k}$ so the initial condition for the mode function when $\eta \to  -\infty$ is
\be
\label{MukLim}
\omega = {\frac{1}{\sqrt{2 k}}} e^{-i k \eta} \,.  %would have hbar if not natural units (as would A)
\ee
This initial condition holds for all modes as long as it is applied well inside the horizon. This
gives us the following initial conditions, see Refs.~\cite{Salopek:1988qh, Huston:2009ac, Huston:2010by}:
%
\begin{eqnarray}
 \delta\varphi |_{\rm{init}} &=& \frac{1}{aM_{\rm{PL}}\sqrt{2k}}e^{-ik\eta} \, ,  \nonumber \\       %%Where does the Mpl come into it, check with hbar???
 \delta{\varphi}_{,\mathcal{N}} |_{\rm{init}} &=& -\frac{1}{aM_{\rm{PL}}\sqrt{2k}}e^{-ik\eta} \left( 1 + i \frac{k}{aH} \right) \, ,
\label{InitCond}
\end{eqnarray}
where $ \eta = -(aH(1-\epsilon_H))^{-1}$ and $\epsilon_H = -\frac{H_{,\mathcal{N}}}{H}$ \, and $\mathcal{N}$ is the number of e-folds defined in Eq.~(\ref{efolds}) .

During slow roll inflation we have a quasi-de Sitter spacetime. 
In the case of a de Sitter spacetime, the Hubble parameter is constant and 
$z''/z = 2/\eta^2$ which means Eq.~(\ref{Muk}) becomes
\be
\omega''(k^i) + \left( k^2 - \frac{2}{\eta^2} \right) \omega(k^i) = 0 \,.
\ee
and has solutions,
\be
\omega = Ae^{-ik\eta}\left(1 - \frac{i}{k\eta}\right) + Be^{ik\eta}\left(1 + \frac{i}{k\eta}\right) \,.
\label{omegasol}
\ee
When we impose the two boundary conditions given by Eq.~(\ref{normal}) and the initial solution in the $\eta \to -\infty$ limit, Eq.~(\ref{MukLim}),
we find that the constants in Eq.~(\ref{omegasol}) are given by $A = 1/\sqrt{2k}$ and $B=0$.
So our solution for de Sitter spacetimes is given by
\be
\label{FlucdeSitt}
\omega = \frac{ e^{-ik\eta}}{\sqrt{2k}} \left(1 - \frac{i}{k\eta} \right) \,.
\ee

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
In the numerical work that follows, once we have implemented the quantum initial conditions, we only consider the evolution of the scalar field perturbations classically. 
There are issues concerning how and when the quantum-to-classical transition takes place but we will not attempt to address these here.
For further discussion on these issues, see for instance, Refs.~\cite{Polarski:1995jg, Lyth:2006qz}. 

% \subsection{Quantum to Classical transition}   %%%% Cut out this section??? 
% 
% These initial quantum fluctuations will go through a transition and become classical in nature.
% In order to see why this happens we need to consider the solution given in Eq.~\ref{FlucdeSitt} 
% well after horizon exit this solution becomes 
% \be
% \label{OmegaDeSitter}
% \omega = \frac{-i}{\sqrt{2k} k \eta} \,.
% \ee
% 
% Before horizon crossing the mode functions ($\omega$) change with time and therefore $u$ is constantly changing between
% different linear combinations of the creation and annihilation operators. 
% Therefore two consecutive measurements would lead to different observations implying $u$ is a quantum object.
% After horizon crossing we can see from Eq.~\ref{OmegaDeSitter} that the mode function is imaginary. 
% Therefore $\omega$ can be factored out of Eq.~\ref{uDec} and $u$
% will always be made up of the same linear combination of creation and annihilation operators. 
% This implies that $u$ can be considered a classical object.  
% %%% Re word this in terms of eigenvectors and eigenstates???

\subsection{Evolving the field fluctuations}

In order to evolve the fluctuations in the scalar field we
use the Einstein and conservation equations in flat gauge outlined in Section~\ref{dynamical}.  
We assume the Klein Gordon equation, Eq.~(\ref{KGback}), 
and Friedmann equation Eq.~(\ref{FriedmannPhi}), in the background
and consider only single field canonical inflation as described in Section~\ref{Inflation}. 
We only consider scalar perturbations which, as explained in Section~\ref{ScVeTe}, will decouple at first order.
The evolution equation for the fluctuations is then given by the perturbed Klein-Gordon equation, Eq.~(\ref{KGeq1st}),
which we gave in Section~\ref{consscalar}.

We present the equation again here in Fourier space, 
\be
\label{KG1_flat}
\delta\vp''+2\H\delta\vp'+ k^2\delta\vp  +a^2\left\{ U_{,\vp\vp} 
+\frac{1}{\H M_{\rm{PL}}^2} \left(2\vp_{0}'U_{,\vp}+{\vp_{0}'}^2\frac{1}{\H M_{\rm{PL}}^2}U_0\right)
\right\}\delta\vp=0\,,
\ee
%
where the Fourier component of the field fluctuation, $\delta\vp (k^i)$, is
related to the fluctuation in real space, $\delta\vp (x^i)$, by
%
\be
\delta\vp (x^i, \eta) = \frac{1}{(2\pi)^3} \int d^3 k \delta\vp (k^i) e^{ik_ix^i} \, .
\ee

% We also have expressions that
%  relate the pressure, $P_0$ and $\delta P$, the energy density $\rho_0$
%  and $\delta\rho_1$ to the scalar field, $\vp_0$ and $\dvp1$,
% which we introduced in section \ref{PressDensIfl1st} but will repeat here for clarity  %%% Don't need this here just refer to previous section... 
%  \bea
%  P_0 &=& \frac{1}{2a^2}{\vp_{0}'}^2- U_0\,,\qquad
%  \rho_0 = \frac{1}{2a^2}{\vp_{0}'}^2+ U_0\,,
%  \eea
%  %
%  and
%  %
%  \bea
%  \delta\rho &=& \frac{1}{a^2}\vp_{0}'\delta\vp'
%  +\left(U_{,\vp}-\frac{3\H}{a^2}\frac{{\vp_{0}'}^3}{{\vp_{0}'}^2+2a^2U}\right)\dvp{}\,, \\
%  \delta P &=& \frac{1}{a^2}\vp_{0}'\delta\vp'
%  -\left(U_{,\vp}+\frac{3\H}{a^2}\frac{{\vp_{0}'}^3}{{\vp_{0}'}^2+2a^2U}\right)\dvp{}\,,

\section{From field fluctuations to observables}
\label{Horizons}

\subsection{The problem of reheating}
\label{reheating}

Now that we have fluctuations to the inflaton field we need to understand how
these fluctuations generate perturbations in the energy density of radiation and matter that we observe today.
Unfortunately, the process describing the decay of the inflaton scalar field into radiation, known as reheating, is not fully understood.
Currently we do not know what particles were initially created or how the energy was transferred from the inflaton to the radiation.

The simplest scenario is one where the scalar field loses energy through oscillations about its minimum.
This corresponds to the decay of particles and can be modelled by the following modified continuity equation,
\be
\dot{\rho} + (3H + \Gamma)\rho = 0 \,,
\ee
 where $\Gamma$ is the particle decay rate.
The decay products are relativistic and the energy quickly thermalizes leaving a species with a blackbody distribution and
eventually all energy is in a radiation species at thermal equilibrium. 
One can simplify this even further by assuming this transition happens instantaneously when $T = T_{\rm{reh}}$,
this is known as instantaneous reheating, and is the model we will be using to evaluate the parameters and initial conditions
for our scalar fields below.
Even when using this model for reheating we must specify by what process the decay happens and give a decay rate. There are also many other
scenarios for how the reheating process happened beyond this simplest example.
For many more details on reheating and the various options for decay rates see for instance Refs.~\cite{Allahverdi:2010xz, Bassett:2005xm}. 


Fortunately there is a method we can use which does not rely on the equations for this unknown process, namely,
we can proceed by considering conserved quantities.
The relative size of a given field fluctuation compared to the Hubble radius ($1/aH$) is important.
As the fluctuations generated initially are quantum fluctuations, they are necessarily created on very small scales (i.e.~$k \gg aH$). We call such
fluctuations subhorizon. 
During inflation, the comoving Hubble rate ($aH$) increases approximately exponentially so the scales of interest will eventually become larger than the comoving Hubble
radius (i.e.~$k \ll aH$) and we say the scales have ``left the horizon''; the fluctuations are now superhorizon.  
During the radiation and matter era the comoving Hubble rate decreases and eventually those same scales will satisfy $k \gg aH$ 
and will cross back inside the horizon again.
As the field fluctuations cross the horizon (i.e.~when the size of the fluctuations is similar to the size of the Hubble radius, $k=aH$) 
they continue to evolve, however there are quantities that under certain conditions remain conserved whilst outside the horizon (in the limit $k \to 0$).
It is these quantities we will study in the following sections.
By mapping the inflaton fluctuation's power spectrum onto the spectrum of one such conserved quantity,
we can connect the fluctuations during inflation to the ones we observe at later times.
For instance, the spectrum of the conserved quantity (e.g. the curvature perturbation, see below) can be used to set the
initial conditions for standard Boltzmann codes see e.g.~Ref.~\cite{camb}, that are used to calculate the CMB anisotropies.


\subsection{Conserved quantities}


We focus here on two quantities which are conserved outside the horizon under certain conditions. Firstly the curvature perturbation on uniform
density hypersurfaces $\zeta$ \cite{Bardeen:1983qw}, and secondly the comoving curvature perturbation $\R$ \cite{Lyth:1984gv}.
% 
The curvature perturbation on uniform density hypersurfaces is defined as
%
\be
\label{defzeta}
-\zeta \equiv \psi + \frac{\H}{\rho_0'}\delta\rho\,,
\ee
%
which simplifies if we evaluate the right hand side in flat gauge to
%
%
%\be
$-\zeta=\frac{\H}{\rho_0'}\delta\rho_{\fl}\,,$
%\ee
% 
where $\delta\rho_{\fl}$ was defined in Eq.~(\ref{denspertflat}). For ease of use we drop the subscript $\fl$ in the
following. In terms of the scalar field perturbations this is
\be
\zeta=\frac{1}{3{\vp_{0}'}^2}  \left[\vp_{0}'\delta\vp'+\left(U_{,\vp}a^2-3\H\frac{{\vp_{0}'}^3}{{\vp_{0}'}^2+2Ua^2}\right)\dvp{} \right]\,,
\ee
The comoving curvature perturbation, that is, the curvature
perturbation evaluated on comoving or uniform field slices, is defined
by
%
\be
\label{defR}
\R \equiv \psi+\frac{\H}{\vp_0'} \delta\vp\,,
\ee
%
which simplifies again if the right hand side is evaluated in flat gauge to
$\R=\frac{\H}{\vp_0'} \delta\vp$.
%
Note that these two gauge-invariant curvature perturbations, defined in different gauges, are related by the constraint equation,
\be
\label{constraint}
k^2 \Psi = -9 \frac{\H^2 {\vp_0'}^2}{2a^2\rho_0} (\R + \zeta)\,,
\ee
% 
where $\Psi = \psi + \H\sigma_{s}$ is the curvature perturbation
in longitudinal gauge. %, that is on uniform shear hypersurfaces. 
As can be seen from \eq{constraint}, $\zeta + \R$ will become small on
super-horizon scales. 


We can determine what conditions are required for these two quantities to be conserved outside the horizon by
considering the evolution equation for the curvature perturbation.
Firstly note that $\zeta$ will be conserved outside the horizon during inflation driven by a single scalar field. %Not true for multi-field inflation REF!!
To consider the period after inflation note that for $k \ll aH $ we have,
\be
\label{EvoZeta}
\dot{\zeta} = \frac{\dot{\rho} \delta P - \dot{P} \delta \rho}{3 (\rho + P)^2} \,.
\ee
Setting the right hand side of this equation equal to zero is equivalent to the
adiabatic condition for a fluid,
\be
\frac{\delta P}{\dot{P}} = \frac{\delta \rho}{\dot{\rho}} \,,
\ee
implying that after inflation the curvature perturbation is conserved for an adiabatic fluid.
Note also that if the pressure can be given as a function of density only ($P = f(\rho)$)
then the right hand side of Eq.~(\ref{EvoZeta}) is also zero, even if the fluctuations are not adiabatic,  %%% Check this??? Is this  different?? 
 and the curvature perturbation is also conserved. 

If the fluid is not adiabatic then there exists a non-adiabatic pressure perturbation, $\dPnad$. 
In general this is not directly observable, but is a source term for the evolution of the
curvature perturbations, (see Ref.~\cite{Wands:2000dp}) and therefore will be a quantity we are interested in. 

The total pressure perturbation is split into an adiabatic and non-adiabatic part as seen in Ref.~\cite{ks},
%
\be
\label{nonad}
\dPnad = \delta P - \cs \delta\rho\,,
\ee
%
where $\cs$ is the adiabatic speed of sound and is defined as $\cs
\equiv {P_0}'/{\rho_0}'$.  This gives us an expression for $\dPnad$
in terms of the scalar field quantities \cite{Christopherson:2008ry},
%
\be 
\dPnad=\Bigg[\frac{U_{,\vp}}{3\H^2 M_{\rm{PL}}^2}\vpb'^2
-2U_{,\vp}\Big(1+\frac{U_{,\vp}a^2}{3\H\vpb'}\Big)\Bigg]\dvp{}
-\frac{2U_{,\vp}}{3\H}\dvp{}'\,.
\ee
This can also be written as
\be 
\label{deltaPnadfinal}
\dPnad=-\frac{2 U_{,\vp} }{3 \H }
\left[\delta\vp' +
\left(\frac{a^2U_{,\vp}}{\vp_0'}+\frac{6\H Ua^2}{{\vp_{0}'}^2+2Ua^2}
\right){\delta\vp}
\right]\,.
\ee


\subsection{Observables}
\label{Obs}

As mentioned above the conserved quantities can be used to set initial conditions for Boltzmann codes. The results of these codes then allow us
to make predictions for the perturbations we see in the CMB.
In order to be able to compare our theoretical results more easily with observations, it is often beneficial to 
present them in terms of power spectra. 
The power spectrum for $\zeta$, $P^2_{\zeta} (k_1)$, is defined as \cite{Liddle:2000cg},
\be
\langle \zeta(\mathbf{k}_1) \zeta(\mathbf{k}_2) \rangle \equiv (2 \pi)^3 \delta (\mathbf{k}_1 + \mathbf{k}_2) P^2_{\zeta} (k_1) \,,
\ee
where $\langle ... \rangle$ denotes the ensemble average. It is also useful to define a
dimensionless power spectrum as, 
\be
\P_{\zeta}^2 (k) \equiv \frac{k^3}{2 \pi^2} P^2_{\zeta} (k) \,.
\ee

Similarly for $\R$ we can define the power spectrum $P^2_{\R} (k_1)$ and the dimensionless power spectrum $\P_{\R}^2 (k)$ as,
\be
\langle \R(\mathbf{k}_1) \R(\mathbf{k}_2) \rangle \equiv (2 \pi)^3 \delta (\mathbf{k}_1 + \mathbf{k}_2) P^2_{\R} (k_1) \,,
\ee
and
\be
\P_{\R}^2 (k) \equiv \frac{k^3}{2 \pi^2} P^2_{\R} (k) \,.
\ee
%\be
%\label{powerdef}
%\P_{\R}(k) = \frac{k^3}{2 \pi^2} \left|\R\right|^2 \,.
%\ee

Both types of curvature perturbation can be used to describe the scalar field perturbation, however, 
we potentially also have tensor perturbations being produced in the early universe.
In the same way as above we can define a tensor power spectrum given by $\P_{T}^2 (k)$ and then define
another observational parameter ($r$) to describe the ratio between the scalar and tensor power spectra,
\be
r \equiv \frac{\P_{T}^2 (k)}{\P_{\R}^2 (k)} \,.
\ee
We expect the power to be dominated by the scalar perturbations and therefore we expect $r$ to be small.
The current upper limit provided by {\sc Planck} is $r < 0.11$ \cite{Ade:2013zuv} whereas 
{\sc Bicep } find $r = 0.20^{+0.07}_{-0.05}$ with $r=0$ disfavored at $7.0 \sigma$. However, it is likely that when
the contribution of foreground dust is accounted for this value for $r$ will decrease by an amount yet to be determined, 
possibly bringing this in line with the {\sc Planck} result \cite{Ade:2014xna}. 


One of the predictions of inflation is a near scale invariant spectrum. 
In order to parametrise how close to scale invariance our observations are we define the spectral index, $n_s$, as
\be
n_s - 1 = \frac{d}{d \rm{ln} k} \rm{ln} \left( \P^2_{\R} (k) \right) \,,
\ee
such that $n_s = 1$ implies scale invariance. 
This allows us to write the dimensionless power spectra as 
\be
\P_{\R}^2 (k) = \Delta_{\R} (k_0)^2 \left( \frac{k}{k_0} \right)^{n_s -1} \,,
\ee
where $\Delta_{\R} (k_0)^2 $ is the amplitude of the power spectrum evaluated at an arbitrary pivot scale ($k_0$).
Current observations from {\sc Wmap} give $\Delta_{\R} (k_0)^2 = 2.38 \times 10^{-9}$ \cite{Hinshaw:2012aka} with a pivot scale of $k_0 = 0.002 \text{Mpc}^{-1}$,
and observations from {\sc Planck} gives $n_s = 0.9616 \pm 0.00094$ (68\%) \cite{Ade:2013zuv}.

If the dependence on $k$ is more complicated than just a simple power law, 
we can introduce a second parameter to explain this dependence, the running ($\alpha_s$),
\be
\alpha_s = \frac{d}{d \ln k}  n_s \,.
\ee
The current  best observations from {\sc Planck} suggest that $\alpha_s = -0.013 \pm 0.009 $ (68\%) \cite{Ade:2013zuv}
\\

\section{Around Horizon crossing}  %%Motivation of work

\subsection{Motivation}
\label{motivation}

In Section~\ref{reheating} we only considered the two limiting cases $k \ll aH$ and $k \gg aH$.
As outlined above it is well known that for adiabatic perturbations the curvature perturbations on both uniform density
hypersurfaces, $\zeta$, and on comoving hypersurfaces, $\R$, are
conserved on large scales where gradient terms can be
neglected (i.e.~in the limiting case where  $k \ll aH$ and $k \to 0$) \cite{Bardeen:1983qw,Lyth:1984gv}. 
This result follows from the conservation of energy \cite{Wands:2000dp} and the evolution equation
for the curvature perturbation given in Eq.~(\ref{EvoZeta}). 
%

The standard approach used to calculate the power spectrum of perturbations
after horizon crossing assumes that the limit $k\to 0$ has been reached, see Ref.~\cite{Copeland:1993jj}.
However, immediately after horizon crossing, the wavenumber will not yet have become sufficiently small
for this limit to be accurate and gradient terms may still play a role.
In fact, in single field inflation there will still be some residual non-adiabatic pressure perturbation,
$\delta P_\mathrm{nad}$, present \cite{Mollerach:1989hu}. Then, even in the absence of other sources of $\delta P_\mathrm{nad}$,
the curvature perturbation will continue to evolve for some number of
e-folds before settling down to its value at the end of inflation.
Although it is known that this evolution continues for a short time after horizon crossing, the exact amount of evolution has not been quantified. 
Exactly how long the evolution will last and how much the magnitude of the power spectrum of $\zeta$ may vary in that time
are issues which are yet to be addressed in the literature. 

This is particularly important as observational cosmology is entering an era in which the data from
observations of LSS and the CMB are becoming much more precise. Only
eight years ago, the {\sc Wmap }  team were quoting cosmological parameters to
an accuracy of about 10\% \cite{Komatsu:2003fd}. Now, as data sets are
improving both in quality and size, the {\sc Wmap } seven year observations
(hereafter WMAP7) can constrain these parameters to within a couple of
percent \cite{Komatsu:2010fb} and {\sc Planck} can do even better. 
Hence it is essential that the quantities we wish to study in
the early universe are understood theoretically to this same level
of precision. 

Much work has been done calculating the power spectra for the curvature
perturbations, $\zeta$ and $\R$, during
inflation (see for example Refs.~\cite{Stewart:1993bc,Grivell:1996sr,Huang:2000bh,Leach:2001zf,Leach:2000yw,Stewart:2001cd}   
and the reviews, Refs.~\cite{Lidsey:1995np,Lyth:1998xn}).  
Analytic studies have to rely on either the slow roll limit, or large scale approximations, to make the
calculations viable.  
In these limits, and without anisotropic stress,  				%%% Move this sentence to above??
the two definitions for the curvature perturbations are equal up to a sign difference, see e.g. Ref.~\cite{Malik:2008im}. 


In the rest of this chapter we will be looking at these conserved quantities in greater detail.
Specifically we will quantify the evolution of the curvature perturbation shortly before, during and after horizon
crossing by considering the following questions:
\bi
\item How do $\zeta$ and $\R$ differ around horizon crossing? 
\item How much do the instantaneous horizon crossing values differ from the values at the end of inflation?
\item How long does it take for the quantities to reach these final values?
\ei
As we do not want to rely on the slow roll approximation or the large
scale limit, we will be solving the Klein-Gordon equations numerically.
However, first we will consider some of the analytic approximations which are used.


\subsection{{Analytic Solutions}}
\label{sec:analytic}

Using numerical techniques we can evaluate the expressions for the curvature perturbation at
any time whereas analytically this is not possible. 
%
To deduce an analytic expression for the
curvature perturbation, such as that used in the popular $\delta N$ formalism, %(see Section~\ref{})
we start from the definition \cite{Liddle:2000cg}
%
\be
\label{powerdef}
\P_{\R}(k) = \frac{k^3}{2 \pi^2} \left|\R\right|^2 \,.   %%%Move this part to observations section above...  How does it fit with the other definition?? Check L&L
\ee
%
By obtaining an exact solution for power-law inflation and taking the $k \to 0$ limit, and then making
an expansion about this solution, we arrive at the following expression \cite{Lidsey:1995np},  %%% Expand on this... add more of the details...
%
\be
\label{PRest2}
\P_{\R}(k)_{\rm{est}2*} = [1 - (2C + 1)\epsilon_{SR} + C\eta_{\rm SR}]^2  \frac{a^2 H^4}{(2\pi)^2 {\vp'_0}^2} \Big|_{k=aH}\,,  %%%Link this to the quantised solution above... 
\ee
%
where $C = -2 + \ln 2 + \gamma$ and $\gamma$ is the Euler constant and $\epsilon_{SR}$ and $\eta_{SR}$ are slow roll parameters defined
in Eq.~(\ref{srepsilon}) and Eq.~(\ref{sreta}).

The expression given in \eq{PRest2} is only valid in the large scale
limit, or equivalently a long time after horizon exit. However, it
must be evaluated exactly when the corresponding mode crosses the
horizon. In order to arrive at an expression which is valid at all times, we would need to consider the
full analytic solution, including logarithmic corrections, as considered to some extent in Ref.~\cite{Burrage:2011hd}.
We shall return to this subject in Section~\ref{sect:highlight}.

The above result holds, to the lowest order in slow roll, for any general
potential and if the slow roll parameters are assumed to be very small
this simplifies to
%
\be
\label{PRest1}
\P_{\R}(k)_{\rm{est}1*} = \frac{a^2 H^4}{(2\pi)^2 {\vp'_0}^2} \Big|_{k=aH}\,.
\ee
In Eq.~(\ref{PRest1}) and Eq.~(\ref{PRest2}) above we have used subscript $\rm{est}*$ to denote that the power spectrum 
has been calculated analytically, using horizon crossing values. The subscript $\rm{est}2*$ denotes the full solution
to lowest order in slow roll, whilst subscript $\rm{est}1*$ denotes an approximation to this solution which holds when the slow roll
parameters are very small.


It is important to recognise that the analytic solution is derived using
the $k\to 0$ limit but is evaluated using quantities at horizon
crossing. Although this has been known in the literature for many
years it is not often made clear when this mixing of late time
solution and horizon crossing values is being used. Here 
we highlight the large magnitude of the inaccuracies which would
result if a na\"ive calculation of the power spectrum at horizon
crossing is performed using horizon crossing values.


For further discussions on the analytic treatment of curvature perturbations close to Horizon crossing, 
we refer to Ref.~\cite{Kinney:2005vj, Byrnes:2009pe}


\subsection{{Numerical Setup}}  
\label{numerical}


As mentioned above instead of relying on the analytic approximations we can
solve the system numerically and in doing so we are following the work done by
Salopek et al.\cite{Salopek:1988qh}, and use a Runge-Kutta code written in Fortran. %Add More details to this section?? 
Following Ref.~\cite{Salopek:1988qh} we set the
initial conditions for each $k$ mode a few e-folds before horizon
crossing when the initial time $\N_{\rm{init}}(k)$ is such that 
\be
\frac{k}{aH|_{\rm{init}}} = 50 \,.
\ee 
This allows us to assume the Bunch-Davies vacuum (see Section~\ref{Quantum}) and therefore have initial conditions described
by Eq.~(\ref{InitCond}) for modes well inside the horizon.
 The linear scalar field perturbations are evolved from this initial state
well inside the horizon until the inflationary expansion ends.

Most of the results we present here use single field chaotic inflation, the simplest single field
inflation model which is in agreement with WMAP7 and {\sc Planck}.
% 
In order to ensure that our results are representative beyond this
simplest model, we also study a set of more complicated cannonical single field
models, $U = U_0 + \frac{1}{2}m^2\vp^2$, $U = \frac{1}{4}\lambda
\vp^4$ and $U = \sigma \vp^{2/3}$.
The parameters for the background system are selected
depending on the choice of potential: 
%% Need to add the remaining parameters below!!
\bi
\item $U = \frac{1}{2}m^2 \vp^2 $ ,  $m = 6.32$ x $10^{-6}M_{\rm{PL}} $ 
%
\item $U = \frac{1}{4}\lambda \vp^4$ , $\lambda = 1.55 \times 10^{-13}$
%
\item $U = U_0 + \frac{1}{2}m^2\vp^2$ , $m_0 = 1.74 \times 10^{-6} M_{\rm{PL}}$ . $U_0 = 5 \times 10^{-10} M_{\rm{PL}}^4$
%
\item $U = \sigma \vp^{2/3}$, $\sigma = 3.82 \times 10^{-10} M_{\rm{PL}}^{10/3}$
%
\ei
The mass values have been chosen such that $\P_{\R}(k) = 2.45$ x $10^{-9}$ at the end of inflation for the {\sc Wmap } pivot scale.
The initial conditions for $\phi_0$ and $\phi_0^{\dagger}$ are again chosen depending on the choice of potential,
so that the k modes which will be calculated begin well inside the horizon, for instance the initial conditions for chaotic inflation
are set as $\vp_0 = 18M_{\rm{PL}}$ and $\vp_{0,\N} = -0.1M_{\rm{PL}}$. 
We are using parameters and initial conditions specified in Ref.~\cite{Huston:2009ac,Huston:2010by}.

We select a finite range of $k$ modes which cover all the modes which have been observed in the CMB. 
The {\sc Wmap } team have released results corresponding to the range $k \in
[3.5$x$10^{-4} , 0.12] \text{Mpc}^{-1}$, we will consider a similar range below. We use the number of e-folds, $\N = \log(a/a_{\rm{init}})$, defined
in Eq.~(\ref{efolds}) as our
time variable instead of conformal time where $a_{\rm{init}}$, the value
of $a$ at the start of inflation, is evaluated by setting $a = 1$ today and using the background run, assuming instantaneous reheating.

The behaviour of all the modes over the scales we consider are
similar, so for clarity only $k_1$, $k_2$ and $k_3$ modes, given
below, have been shown in the graphs that follow, where: 
\bea
k_1 &=& 2.77 \mbox{ x } 10^{-5} \text{Mpc}^{-1} = 7.28 \mbox{ x } 10^{-62} M_{\rm{PL}} \\
k_2 &=& 2.00 \mbox{ x } 10^{-3} \text{Mpc}^{-1} = 5.25 \mbox{ x } 10^{-60} M_{\rm{PL}} \quad \text{({\sc Wmap } pivot)}\\
k_3 &=& 1.45 \mbox{ x } 10^{-1} \text{Mpc}^{-1} = 3.80 \mbox{ x } 10^{-58} M_{\rm{PL}} \,.
\eea
It is worth noting that $k_2$ is the {\sc Wmap } pivot scale.
 We compare these numerical results with the standard analytic solutions for single field inflation.  
All the numerical results presented below have been verified with a second independent numerical program to 
ensure their accuracy, see Ref.~\cite{Huston:2011vt}.



\section{{Results}}
\label{sec:results}
 
In this section we present our results which attempt to answer the questions presented above. We quantify
the difference between $\zeta$ and $\R$, the magnitude of
error incurred if we would use \eq{powerdef} evaluated at horizon
crossing instead of \eq{PRest2}, and the length of time taken for the
power spectra to settle to their values at the end of inflation.
The results presented in the graphs below are for the potential $U = \frac{1}{2} m^2\vp ^2$. 


To start we consider the evolution of the power spectra in general. 
The evolution, and indeed conservation, of the curvature perturbations has been studied in
detail in the past, see Ref.~\cite{Bardeen:1983qw, Lyth:1984gv,GarciaBellido:1995qq,Wands:2000dp} and,
as expected, we find that some time shortly after horizon crossing
there is no longer any appreciable evolution in either the power
spectrum of $\zeta$, $\P_{\zeta}(k)$ or the power spectrum of $\R$,
$\P_{\R}(k)$, see Fig.~\ref{fig:1a}. The values of these power
spectra converge very quickly onto the same conserved value. This
behaviour is also supported by the graph in Fig.~\ref{fig:1b}
which shows the non-adiabatic pressure perturbation, $\dPnad$. We
find, again as expected, that during and after horizon crossing the
size of $\dPnad$ drops sharply towards zero. The non-adiabatic
pressure perturbation is directly related to the curvature
perturbation (on large scales), see Ref.~\cite{GarciaBellido:1995qq,Wands:2000dp}, %%%% REF the equations outlining this above
%
\be
{\zeta}' \propto \dPnad\, , %%%Move this up to the section above
\ee  
%
and hence the rapid decrease in the non-adiabatic pressure
perturbation causes the curvature perturbations to settle onto a
conserved value. 

However, it can also be seen from Fig. \ref{fig:1a} that there is
some evolution of the power spectra immediately after horizon
crossing.  As already stated this is well known in the literature where the phrase `soon
after horizon crossing' is commonly used to refer to the time at which
the power spectra have settled down.  In the sections that follow we
will be looking at this evolution in more detail and in particular
quantifying exactly how soon after horizon crossing the power spectra
reach their final value and how different this is to the horizon crossing values.

\subsection{{How do $\zeta$ and $\R$ differ?}}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

$\zeta$ and $\R$ are often used interchangeably.  
Although they have different definitions, see
\eq{defzeta} and \eq{defR}, it is well known that on large scales they
are equivalent, as can be seen from \eq{constraint}. This equivalence
is however only strictly true in the large scale limit, and on
smaller, finite scales this is not the case. In Fig.~\ref{fig:1a} we
see that there is a difference between the two curvature perturbations
near to horizon crossing. Three different $k$-modes are plotted
throughout their evolution, from deep within the horizon through
horizon crossing (indicated by the dotted lines), until the end of
inflation.


Fig.~\ref{fig:zetaoverR} shows that $\zeta$ is as much as 20\%
larger than $\R$ at horizon crossing and remains significantly larger
for at least a couple of e-folds. This highlights the importance of
making explicit the choice of curvature perturbation when carrying out
calculations close to horizon crossing. We also note that $\zeta$ and
$\R$ take slightly different amounts of time to settle down after
horizon exit, as detailed in Section~\ref{sect:howquickly}.

{The percentage difference between $\P(k)$ evaluated, numerically, at the end of inflation and the $\P(k)$ obtained at each time step.

Both the graphs above are plotted for three different $k$ modes. The black line (left) is $k_1$, the blue line (middle) is $k_2$,
the {\sc Wmap } pivot scale, and the red line (right) is $k_3$.}
    \label{fig:pcchange}
  \end{center}
\end{figure}


As mentioned above it is well known that the values of the curvature
perturbation power spectra are not the same at horizon crossing as
they are at the end of inflation. However, it is not clear exactly how
much of an error would be incurred if one would use the horizon crossing
values instead of the correct values at the end of inflation.  In
Fig. \ref{fig:pcchange} we can see exactly how different the power
spectra are at horizon crossing compared to the values they take at
the end of inflation.  In Fig. \ref{fig:pcR} $\P_{\R}(k)$ is 100\%
larger at horizon crossing and in Fig. \ref{fig:pczeta}
$\P_{\zeta}(k)$ is 180\% larger.  
In fact if we use an analytic approximation that does take into account 
this behaviour we can see the 100\% difference in the power 
spectra. Near horizon crossing the scalar field's wavefunction ($\psi$) is 
approximately proportional to $(1-ik\eta)e^{ik\eta}$.  %%% REF section above.... 
At horizon crossing $|k\eta| = 1$ and 
$|\psi|^2 \propto |1-ik\eta| = 2$.  A few e-folds later, $|k\eta| \approx 0$ and 
$|\psi|^2 \propto |1| = 1$. This is a drop of 1. Hence the power spectra at 
horizon crossing is expected to be roughly 100\% larger than that at late times. 
The factor of two difference in $\P_{\R}(k)$, has previously been found analytically, see 
for example Ref.~\cite{Polarski:1995jg, Byrnes:2009pe} 
This is, however, a large difference and might impact on calculations if 
$\P(k)_{k=aH}$ is used to approximate the value of the power spectra at 
the end of inflation.

Table \ref{table:1} gives the exact number of e-folds for various potentials.}
    \label{fig:pclines}
  \end{center}
\end{figure}


The expressions ``soon after horizon crossing'' and ``a few e-folds
after horizon crossing'' are often used in the literature to determine
when it is reasonable to evaluate the power spectra, so that one can
be confident that they have the same value as at the end of
inflation.  Now that we have established that the values at horizon
crossing can be as much as 180\% greater than those at the end of
inflation we can study exactly how long after horizon crossing we
must wait until the power spectra converge onto these final values.
Fig. \ref{fig:pclines} shows how many e-folds one needs to wait for
the power spectra to be within 10\% and 1\% of the value they have at
the end of inflation.  It is clear from these graphs that this is
independent of $k$ and is in the region of ``a few e-folds''.  Table
\ref{table:1} shows the number of e-folds it takes to be within a
fixed percentage of the final value, and also shows data for the three
additional potentials we investigated. The choice of potential makes
 little difference to the result.  For every potential considered 
it took 1.40
-- 1.44 e-folds for $\P_{\zeta}(k)$ to be within 10\% and 2.56 -- 2.86
to be within 1\%.  It took 1.14 -- 1.20 e-folds for $\P_{\R}(k)$ to be
within 10\% and 2.30 -- 3.21 e-folds to be within 1\%.  As we
highlighted in Section~\ref{introduction} observational data will
soon be constraining observables to within a percent, so this is at least the
accuracy we would like to be able to evaluate quantities to.  Our
results show that to be within 1\% of the correct power spectra value
at the end of inflation, evaluating $\P_{\R}(k)$ approximately 3.2
e-folds after horizon crossing and evaluating $\P_{\zeta}$ 2.9 e-folds
after horizon crossing, would be sufficient, for all the potentials we
studied.

\label{fig:spectral2}
\end{figure}

In Fig.~\ref{fig:spectral1} and Fig.~\ref{fig:spectral2} the evolution of the two types of curvature perturbation, 
$\P_{\R}(k)$ and $\P_{\zeta}(k)$ are plotted against the number of e-folds, $\N$.
These numerical solutions are compared to the correct analytic solution with and without slow roll corrections, \eq{PRest2} and \eq{PRest1},
and the na\"ive approximation of evaluating the power spectra at horizon crossing. 

In most analytic calculations an expression for the power spectrum is
derived using the $k \to 0$ limit but is evaluated using quantities at
horizon crossing, as given in \eq{PRest2}. As we mentioned in
Section~\ref{motivation}, it is often not made explicitly clear
in the literature when the mixing of late time solution and horizon
crossing values is being used, even when this is well understood by
the authors.  In Fig.~\ref{fig:spectral1} we compare both this correct
analytic solution and the na\"ive calculation of the power spectrum at
horizon crossing performed using horizon crossing values with the
numerical solutions. In Fig.~\ref{fig:spectral1}, as expected, the
correct analytic solution gives a very good estimate to the full
numerical solution. Even the analytic solution without the slow roll
correction, given in \eq{PRest1}, is a very good estimate to the
full solution. In fact the error in not including the slow roll
corrections for the {\sc Wmap } scale is only a slight underestimate of
-0.38\%. However, when we compare the numerical solution to
$\P_{\R}(k)$ evaluated at horizon crossing we find, as shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:pcR}, 
that there is a 100\% error in our answer. As we have
shown earlier in Fig.~\ref{fig:pczeta}, if we evaluated the
$\P_{\zeta}(k)$ at horizon crossing the error would be even higher at
180\%. This difference in the two power spectra can be seen clearly in
Fig.~\ref{fig:spectral1}. This again highlights the importance of
establishing that the correct analytic expression is used in
calculations, and also when different calculations and results are compared.

Another possible source of error would be to use the analytic
expression given in \eq{PRest2} above, but not to evaluate it at
horizon crossing. If one were to evaluate this expression `some e-folds
after horizon crossing', one would underestimate the amplitude of the
power spectrum. This corresponds to following the red line in Fig.
\ref{fig:spectral2}. For example, evaluating \eq{PRest2} four e-folds after
horizon crossing would incur an error of 15\%. Furthermore, evaluating
the power spectrum at later and later times will increase the error.
Lastly, it is worth noting that although the analytic and numerical expressions
agree in the large scale limit, they do not agree with each other shortly after horizon crossing.
As shown in the section above one must wait at least 3.2 e-folds for these two values to agree. 
This is particularly important if there is a second phase of evolution caused for example by a second scalar field which   
starts to dominate during these three e-folds, see for instance Ref.~\cite{Kinney:2005vj}.

\subsection{{The Spectral Index}}
\label{sect:spectral}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\begin{figure}[ht!]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=130mm]{Figure_6.pdf} 
\caption[Evolution of the spectral index]{The evolution of the spectral index for the two curvature perturbations, 
$n_{\R}$ and $n_{\zeta}$, are plotted against the number of e-folds, $\N$.

\label{fig:spectral}
\end{figure}

Using observations we can gain information about the power spectrum of curvature perturbations, which in turn allows us to constrain cosmological theories.
Many observational results are given in terms of a few observables which can then be compared directly with predictions given by theories. One such 
observable is the spectral index. This describes the scale dependence of the power spectrum of the curvature perturbation.
The spectral index for $\zeta$ and $\R$ are defined by \cite{Liddle:2000cg}
\be
n_{\zeta} - 1 \equiv \frac{d\rm{ln}\P_{\zeta}(k)}{d\rm{ln}k} \, , \qquad  n_{\R} - 1 \equiv \frac{d\rm{ln}\P_{\R}(k)}{d\rm{ln}k} \, .
\ee


As an example of how the results presented in this paper will impact on particular observables we consider the spectral index in more detail presenting
results using chaotic inflation. 
Figure \ref{fig:spectral} shows, as expected, that just like the curvature perturbation the spectral index continues to evolve for a few e-folds after
the mode has crossed outside the horizon. Evaluating the spectral index naively at horizon crossing gives a results of $n_{\R} \approx 2$ and 
$n_{\zeta} \approx 2.3$, which is an error in both cases of more than 100\%. We find that in order for $n_{\zeta}$ and $n_{\R}$ to be within 1\% of their 
values at the end of inflation, we should evaluate them at least 2.91 and 2.66 e-folds after horizon crossing, respectively. These values are 
similar but slightly less than the number of e-folds it takes for the power spectrum to be within 1\% of it's final value, (see Table 1). 




\section{{Discussion}}
\label{sec:conclusions}

In this chapter we have studied the evolution of the curvature
perturbations after inflation in detail and highlighted where possible
errors may arise. As we are entering an era where we can hope to constrain
cosmological parameters to within a percent using the observational
data from e.g.~{\sc Planck}, it is of particular importance that these
errors are both quantified and minimised.  

After presenting the evolution equations for the scalar field, we gave
the expressions for the curvature perturbations we consider. We then
outlined the numerical methods used to solve these equations and gave
details of the various models and the initial conditions used. In
presenting our results, we found that despite $\zeta$ and $\R$ being
equivalent very far outside the horizon, the difference between $|\R|$
and $|\zeta|$ at horizon crossing can be as much as 20\%.  We also
found the error in evaluating the power spectra numerically at horizon crossing
instead of either using the correct analytic expression or the full
numerical solution at late times can be as much as 180\% for $\P_{\zeta}(k)$ and
100\% for $\P_{\R}$.  Lastly, we showed that if one wanted to evaluate
the power spectra without the use of the analytic expression
\eq{PRest2}, one would need to wait at least 3.2 e-folds to ensure the
answer for $\P_{\R}(k)$ is correct to within 1\% of the value at the
end of inflation, and one would need to wait at least 2.9 e-folds to
ensure the answer for $P_{\zeta}$ is correct to within 1\%.  
There was no significant difference to these results when we considered the
three additional single field models presented at the end of Section~\ref{numerical}. 

We emphasise that there is a difference between analytic 
and numerical expressions close to the horizon. The numerical results 
are the instantaneous values of the power spectrum and spectral index 
at horizon crossing, not the expected late time values. These instantaneous 
results, while not of observational significance, are useful in many ways, 
including providing initial conditions for other analytical or numerical schemes 
which operate purely outside the horizon. Firstly, if we are interested 
in the late time values we should not take the `na\"{\i}ve' numerical approach 
of evaluating these at horizon crossing. Unlike the case when using the 
analytic expressions these results will not be close to the correct answer. 
Secondly, if we are interested in the instantaneous values at or close to 
horizon crossing, for instance when developing codes which rely on this 
information, the normal analytic expressions will not give the correct 
answers as they are no longer valid and one needs to use numerical methods. 

In this chapter we have only studied single field
inflation models, in which the non-adiabatic pressure decays rapidly,
see Fig.~\ref{fig:1b}. This is no longer the case in multi-field
systems, as a recent work, Ref.~\cite{Huston:2011fr} has detailed. 
It will be interesting to repeat our analysis for more complicated models 
where superhorizon evolution of the curvature
perturbation is expected. This would include, multi-field 
inflation or ``ultra slow roll inflation'', see for instance Ref.~
\cite{Kinney:2005vj, Leach:2001zf}. Since in this thesis we focus on 
the single field case, we postpone a study of these cases to future work.

We have chosen the end of inflation as a natural end point of our
calculations. After the end of inflation the inflaton is assumed to
decay into the standard matter fields during reheating, the detailed
mechanism of which is as yet unclear. Also, after reheating we have a
multi-fluid system, and hence automatically $\dPnad\neq 0$\cite{Brown:2011dn}, 
which means that the curvature perturbations are no longer
conserved (on any scale). Consequently the values at the end of
reheating may no longer be the same as those at the end of
inflation.

In conclusion, we have highlighted the fact that the different
curvature perturbations do evolve differently immediately after
horizon exit. Confusion between the different curvature perturbations can
introduce additional errors when comparing theoretical results with
observations, which however can easily be avoided, if the correct choice
of curvature perturbation is made.
