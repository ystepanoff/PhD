We present a uniform approach to the construction of the groups of type $\EE_6$ over arbitrary fields without using Lie theory, in
the spirit of \cite{WilsonBook}. Where possible, all proofs are obtained from basic principles, which minimises the number of dependencies, 
making the approach to the construction elementary and self-contained. In particular, we prove the simplicity of the groups of type 
$\EE_6$ and illuminate some of the related geometry. Method, discussed in this thesis gives a simple description of the 
group generators and some of the subgroup structure. In the finite case our approach also permits relatively straightforward 
computation of the group order. We also investigate the possibility of obtaining a similar construction for the groups of type ${}^2\EE_6$. 
In particular, we 
study a potential generating set as well as obtain some elements of the subgroup structure.
