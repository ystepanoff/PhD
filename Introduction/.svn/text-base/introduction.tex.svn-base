\label{Intro}

It is currently a great time to be a Cosmologist. After several decades with very little observational data available, the last two decades have
seen not only an influx in data but also a vast improvement in the quality of that data. One of the main observational probes used to study cosmology is
the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB), the radiation that was first emitted during photon decoupling. This is the oldest light in the Universe and
allows us to look back to a time when the universe was less than half a million years old. 
The first discovery of the CMB in 1964 by Penzias and Wilson \cite{Penzias:1965wn} was a very important test for the standard Big Bang model of cosmology,
but it was not until the results of COBE \cite{Bennett:1994gg}, just over 20 years ago, that the tiny anisotropies that would shape the study of cosmology
in the following decades were discovered. Since then two satellites, firstly {\sc Wmap } \cite{Komatsu:2010fb, Hinshaw:2012aka} and more recently {\sc Planck} \cite{Ade:2013zuv}, 
have improved upon the data collected by COBE. 
The evidence we have so far supports the current best theory that the universe started with a phase of rapid expansion known as inflation
followed successively by radiation-dominated and matter-dominated eras which are described in the standard Big Bang model.
With these detailed observations we are now able to constrain more theoretical models than ever before. 

Cosmological perturbation theory (CPT) provides the theoretical framework for the detailed study of the anisotropies in the CMB. 
For a full review see Ref.~\cite{Malik:2008im} and the references therein. 
CPT is built around the well motivated assumption that our universe is largely isotropic and homogeneous.
When working within CPT we use a smooth background, to which we add inhomogeneous perturbations to describe 
the small scale detail of our universe.
These perturbations are then split order by order
and into different types: scalar, vector and tensor.
Cosmological perturbation theory has a long history. The very first studies were carried out by
by Lifshitz and Bonner \cite{Lifshitz:1945du, Lifshitz:1963ps} and the
first covariant study by Hawking \cite{Hawking:1966qi} and Olsen \cite{Olson:1976jc}. 
The real groundwork though to modern linear CPT, which is still used today came in the 1980's by
Bardeen \cite{Bardeen:1980kt}, followed by review articles by
Sasaki \cite{Kodama:1985bj} and Mukhanov, Feldman and Brandenberger \cite{Brandenberger:1992qj}. 
An alternative approach is the covariant approach studied by Ellis \& collaborators \cite{Ellis:1989jt, Ellis:1989ju, Ellis:1990gi}
and the first paper relating covariant to metric approach was by Bruni \cite{Bruni:1992dg}. 
In the last 15 years or so as observations have improved it has been necessary to go beyond linear order to second order 
and there are many papers on this \cite{Acquaviva:2002ud, Bartolo:2004if, Bruni:1996im, Christopherson:2011hn, Malik:2005cy, Malik:2003mv, Mukhanov:1996ak,
Nakamura:2003wk, Nakamura:2010yg, Noh:2004bc}. Recently there have even been attempts to begin to understand third order perturbation 
theory and any interesting effects which may appear at this order \cite{Christopherson:2009fp}.

The main subjects of this thesis are applications of CPT to various problems and questions in modern cosmology. 
The rest of this chapter gives a brief overview of the standard Big Bang model of cosmology and inflation. Then in Chapter 2
we describe CPT in detail using linear perturbation theory as a starting point. 
In Chapter 3 we move on to our first application which examines the conservation of the curvature perturbation during inflation. In
Chapter 4 we look at perturbation theory in the case where we have multiple species and how one might solve systems of Boltzmann like
equations without resorting to numerics. 
The second half of the thesis is based around an application of CPT to primordial magnetic field generation.
Given that the latter is quite a large topic in itself with much history, Chapter 5 contains mainly an introduction to this field as well as a full
derivation of the covariant Maxwell equations up to second order. In Chapter 6 we then provide a full analytic derivation of the magnitude
and scale dependence of the magnetic fields generated by perturbations, with a comparison to previous numeric work. 
We end this thesis with our conclusions and future outlook in the final chapter. 



\section{{Big Bang cosmology}}
\label{BBC}

\subsection{{FLRW metric}}
\label{FRW}

Observations \cite{Ade:2013nlj, Komatsu:2010fb} 
suggest that on large scales our universe looks largely homogeneous and isotropic. If we apply the cosmological 
principle, that is to assume that we do not live in a particularly special part of the universe, then it follows that on large 
scales, the universe is homogeneous and isotropic everywhere.
In addition, observations indicate that our universe is not static but expanding.
The simplest description of a homogeneous, isotropic and expanding spacetime is given by the Friedmann-Lemaitre-Robertson-Walker (FLRW) metric, 
with line element,
\be
ds^2 = -dt^2 + a^2 (t) d\Omega^2 \,,
\ee
where $t$ is coordinate time and $a$ is the scale factor which describes the expansion of the universe.
$d\Omega$ is given by,
\be
d \Omega^2 = \frac{dr^2}{1 - kr^2} + r^2 (d\theta^2 + \sin^2 \theta d\phi^2 ) \,,
\ee
where ($r$, $\theta$, $\phi$) are the spherical spatial coordinates. 
This is the most general spatial geometry which is both homogeneous and isotropic.
It allows for a uniform global curvature which is denoted by $k$, where $k=0$ denotes a flat universe,
$k=-1$ denotes a negatively curved, (i.e.~open), universe and $k = 1$ denotes a positively
curved, (i.e.~closed), universe.

We have some freedom in defining the scale factor and therefore can use this to fix $a=1$ today.
The rate of change of the scale factor is denoted by the Hubble parameter
\be
H = \frac{\dot{a}}{a} \,,
\ee
where a dot ($\dot{}$) represents differentiation with respect to coordinate time. 
Due to the homogeneity and isotropy of our universe both $a$ and $H$ are only
dependent on time and not on spatial coordinates.


The most recent evidence from {\sc Planck} \cite{Ade:2013vbw, Ade:2013zuv} suggests that we live in a flat (or close to flat) universe,
therefore for the remainder of this thesis we will be considering only a flat metric with $k = 0$.
This allows us to write the FLRW line element in Cartesian coordinates as 
\be
ds^2 = -dt^2 + a^2 (t) \delta_{i j} dx^i dx^j = g_{\mu \nu} dx^{\mu} dx^{\nu} \,,
\ee
where the roman indices run from 1 to 3 and $(x_1,x_2,x_3)$ are the Cartesian spatial coordinates. 
The Greek indices run from 0 to 3 and $x_0$ is the time coordinate (in this case coordinate time)
and $g^{\mu \nu}$ is the FLRW metric.  

Alternatively we can also express this metric in terms of conformal time,
\be
ds^2 = a^2 (\eta) ( - d\eta^2 + \delta^{i j} dx_i dx_j ) \,,
\label{FLRWconf}
\ee
where conformal time ($\eta$) is defined by
\be
\eta(t) = \int^t_{\infty} \frac{1}{a(\tilde{t})} d\tilde{t} \,,
\ee
and the conformal Hubble parameter is
\be
\H = \frac{a'}{a} \,,
\ee
and dash ($'$) represents differentiation with respect to conformal time. 
The conformal Hubble parameter is related to the coordinate Hubble parameter by
\be
aH = \H \,.
\ee
In the line element above $(\eta, \mathbf{x})$ are comoving coordinates, the spatial comoving coordinates are related to the physical 
coordinates, ($\mathbf{d}$), by
\be
\mathbf{d} = a(t) \mathbf{x} \,.
\ee
For the remainder of the thesis unless stated otherwise we will present equations in conformal rather than coordinate time.

\subsection{{General Relativity}}
\label{GR}

The language we use to describe the universe we live in is that of General Relativity (GR), 
we will give a brief overview here for a complete picture see
Ref.~\cite{Misner:1974qy}.  
The mathematics of GR is defined on differentiable smooth manifolds, so
in order to be able to define differentiation of tangent vector fields we must make a choice of affine connection.
In the presence of a metric the natural choice is to pick the unique torsion-free metric connection, i.e.~the Levi-Civita
connection, which is given by the Christoffel symbols, defined in terms of the metric as
\be
\Gamma^{\alpha}_{\beta \gamma} = \frac{1}{2} g^{\alpha \delta} ( g_{\delta \beta , \gamma} + g_{\delta \gamma, \beta} - g_{\beta \gamma, \delta} ) \,,
\label{Christoffel}
\ee
which, due to the connection being torsion-free, are necessarily symmetric. 
The comma (,) in the above equation denotes a partial derivative for example $g_{\alpha \beta , \gamma} = \frac{\partial}{\partial x^{\gamma}} g_{\alpha \beta}$.
Using the FLRW metric defined in Eq.~(\ref{FLRWconf}) we find that the non-zero connection coefficients are
\be
\Gamma^{0}_{0 0} = \H \,, \quad \Gamma^0_{ij} = \H \delta_{ij} \,, \quad \Gamma^i_{0 j} = \Gamma^i_{j 0} = \H \delta^i_j \,.
\ee
Now that we have picked the affine connection we are able to define covariant differentiation, which we denote using either a $\nabla$ or a semi-colon (;),
for instance
\be
v^{\mu}\,_{;\nu} = \nabla_{\nu} v^{\mu} = \partial_{\nu} v^{\mu} + \Gamma^{\mu}_{\nu \rho} v^{\rho} \,.
\ee


In order to use GR we will also be interested in the curvature of our spacetime.
The Riemann curvature tensor measures the intrinsic curvature of Riemannian manifolds and can be defined
in terms of the Christoffel symbols
\be
R^{\alpha}_{\beta \gamma \delta} = \Gamma^{\alpha}_{\delta \beta , \gamma} - \Gamma^{\alpha}_{\gamma \beta , \delta} 
+  \Gamma^{\alpha}_{\gamma \lambda}\Gamma^{\lambda}_{\delta \beta} + \Gamma^{\alpha}_{\delta \lambda}\Gamma^{\lambda}_{\gamma \beta} \,.
\label{Riemann}
\ee
We can also define the Ricci tensor as the contraction of the Riemann tensor as
\be
R_{\beta \delta} = R^{\alpha}_{\beta \alpha \delta} = \Gamma^{\alpha}_{\delta \beta , \alpha} - \Gamma^{\alpha}_{\alpha \beta , \delta} 
+  \Gamma^{\alpha}_{\alpha \lambda}\Gamma^{\lambda}_{\delta \beta} + \Gamma^{\alpha}_{\delta \lambda}\Gamma^{\lambda}_{\alpha \beta} \,,
\ee
and the Ricci or curvature scalar 
\be
R = g^{\beta \delta}R_{\beta \delta} \,.
\ee
Einstein's field equations are given by
\be
G_{\mu \nu} = 8 \pi G T_{\mu \nu} \,,
\label{Einstein}
\ee
where the Einstein tensor, $G_{\mu \nu}$ is defined in terms of the Ricci tensor as
\be
G_{\mu \nu} = R_{\mu \nu} - \frac{1}{2} R g_{\mu \nu} \,,
\ee
and $T_{\mu \nu}$ is the stress energy tensor, which describes the matter content of the universe. 

\subsection{{Energy-Momentum Tensor and Conservation Equation}}
\label{StressEnergy}

To make use of the equations of GR, we need to describe the matter content of the universe.
We can describe the 4-momentum's density and flux using the symmetric energy-momentum tensor. 
For a perfect fluid, that is, one in thermodynamic equilibrium, the energy-momentum tensor is given by
\be
T^{\mu \nu} = (\rho + P)u^{\mu}u^{\nu} + P g^{\mu \nu} \,.
\label{stressenergyPerfect}
\ee
Here $u^{\mu}$ is the 4-velocity, which satisfies the constraint $u^{\mu}u_{\mu} = -1$ and when using the FLRW metric in Eq.~(\ref{FLRWconf}) is given by
\be
u^{\mu} = \frac{1}{a}(1,0,0,0) \,.
\ee
$\rho$ is the fluid density and $P$ is the fluid pressure.
Using the description of the metric in Eq.~(\ref{FLRWconf}) this means that the only non-zero components of the stress-energy tensor for a perfect fluid are
\be
T^{00} = \rho \,,\quad T^{ij} = P \delta^{i j} \,.
\ee


The Riemann tensor defined in Eq.~(\ref{Riemann}) also satisfies the Bianchi identity
\be
\nabla_{[\alpha}R_{\beta \gamma ] \delta \epsilon} = 0 \,,
\ee
which when combined with Eq.~(\ref{Einstein}) gives the following continuity equation
\be
\label{Cont}
T^{\mu \nu}\,_{;\mu} = 0 \,,
\ee
and also implies
\be
G^{\mu \nu}\,_{;\mu} = 0 \,.
\ee
Substituting the energy-momentum tensor from Eq.~(\ref{stressenergyPerfect}) into Eq.~(\ref{Cont}) gives only one non-zero equation, the continuity equation, 
\be
\rho' + 3\H (\rho + P) = 0 \,.
\label{consback}
\ee
We also introduce the equation of state
\be
P = \omega \rho \,,
\label{equofstate}
\ee
where $\omega$ is the equation of state parameter.
When the equation of state parameter is a constant, for instance in the case of a perfect fluid, we can solve the continuity equation to find an expression for $\rho$
in terms of the scale factor,
\be
\rho = \rho_{0} a^{-3(1+\omega)} \,,
\label{rho}
\ee
where $\rho_0$ is the value of the energy density evaluated today.

\subsection{{Friedmann Equations}}
\label{Friedmann}

We now look to combine our knowledge of GR with that of the stress-energy tensor to find equations describing the evolution
of the scale factor.
Returning to the Einstein field equations and substituting the energy-momentum tensor from Eq.~(\ref{stressenergyPerfect}) and 
the connection coefficients given in Eq.~(\ref{Christoffel}) we find two non-zero Einstein equations.
The 00 component gives us the Friedmann equation
\be
\H^2 = \frac{8\pi G a^2}{3} \rho \,,
\ee
and the ij components give us the Raychaudhuri equation 
\be
\H' = - \frac{4\pi G a^2}{3} (\rho + 3P) \,.
\ee

Using the equation of state, Eq.~(\ref{equofstate}), and the solution for the density, Eq.~(\ref{rho}) we find the scale factor and Hubble parameter in terms
of conformal time,
\be
a = \left( \frac{\eta}{\eta_0} \right)^{2/(1 + 3\omega)} \,, \quad \H = \frac{2}{1 + 3\omega} \eta^{-1} \,.
\ee
Assuming that the universe is filled with a single component we can proceed to find exact solutions to the equations above.
For dust (m), where we have $\omega =0$, we find
\be
\rho_{\rm{m}} = \rho_{0\rm{m}} a^{-3} \,, \quad a = \left(\frac{\eta}{\eta_0}\right)^2 \,,  %% a = \left(\frac{t}{t_0}\right)^{2/3}   , \eta_i = 0
\ee
and for radiation ($\gamma$), where we have $\omega = 1/3$, we find  %%%radiation here can be photons and/or neutrinos 
\be
\rho_{{\gamma}} = \rho_{0{\gamma}} a^{-4} \,, \quad a = \left(\frac{\eta}{\eta_0}\right) \,.  %% a = \left(\frac{t}{t_0}\right)^{1/2}  , \eta_i = 0
\ee
Finally for a cosmological constant ($\Lambda$), where we have $\omega = -1 $, we find
\be
\rho_{\Lambda} = \rho_{0\Lambda}  \,, \quad a = - \left(\frac{\eta}{\eta_0}\right)^{-1} \,.  %% a \prop e^{Ht}  , \eta_i = - \infty
\ee
This implies that the radiation density decreases at a faster rate than the matter density, which in turn decreases at a faster rate than the cosmological constant. 
As the universe is initially dominated by radiation this implies that we will have a radiation dominated period followed by a matter dominated period
and finally a dark energy dominated period. 



We can also define a density parameter $\Omega$,
\be
\Omega - 1 \equiv \frac{k}{\dot{a}^2} \,,
\label{DensPar}
\ee
where $\Omega = 1$ corresponds to a geometrically flat universe. 
There exists a critical density, defined as the density of the universe that would lead to an exactly flat spatial geometry ($\Omega = 1$).
From the Friedmann equation we can see that this density would be,
\be
\rho_c = \frac{3 H_0^2}{8 \pi G} \,,
\ee
where $H_0$ is the Hubble parameter evaluated today. 
This means Eq.~(\ref{DensPar}) can be written as,
\be
\Omega = \frac{\rho}{\rho_c} \,.
\ee

So far we have only considered a universe which contains a single component, either radiation, matter or a cosmological constant:
It is of course more realistic to have a mixture of different types of matter. 
If we have more than one type of matter in our universe each with a different density ($\rho_i$) and pressure ($P_i$) then
we can define individual density parameters for each type of matter ($i$)
\be
\Omega_i = \frac{\rho_i}{\rho_c} \,.
\ee
The total density, pressure and density parameter are then given by
\be
\rho = \sum_i \rho_i \,, \quad P = \sum_i P_i \,, \quad \Omega = \sum_i \Omega_i \,.
\ee
The latest observations by {\sc Planck} indicate that
today our universe is filled with four species: baryonic matter (b), collisionless dark matter (c), radiation ($\gamma$) and dark energy ($\Lambda$) (or a cosmological constant).
The observed values for the density parameters today are, at the 68\% confidence level \cite{Ade:2013zuv},
\bea
h^2 \Omega_{b} &=& 0.02207 \pm 0.00033 \,, \\
h^2 \Omega_{c} &=& 0.1196 \pm 0.0031 \,, \\
\Omega_{\Lambda} &=& 0.686 \pm 0.020 \,,
\eea
where $h$ is related to the Hubble parameter by $H = 100h$ and was found by {\sc Planck} to be $h = 0.674 \pm 1.4$ (68\% confidence level). %%%%% Check this!!!
The curvature density parameter at 95\% confidence level including data from {\sc Planck} and Baryon Acoustic Oscillations
is given by  \cite{Ade:2013zuv}
\be
\Omega_{k} =  -0.0005 ^{+0.0065}_{-0.0066} \,.  
\label{Omegak}
\ee
This implies our universe today is dominated by dark energy and is very close to being flat.
A more detailed description of multi-fluid dynamics is given in Chapter~\ref{multifluid}.




%\section{Distances and times in cosmology} %% Do we want this here??

%Particle Horizon, the distance light could have traveled since the beginning of the universe
%\be
%x(t) = \int^t_0 \frac{dt}{a} 
%\ee
%If events are seperated by more than $2x$ then they will never have been in causal contact. 

%The Horizon, or Hubble length is given by $1/H$, the comoving horizon (comoving Hubble length) is given by $1/\H$




\section{{Inflationary cosmology}}
\label{Inflation}

\subsection{{Inflation as a solution to the problems of the Big Bang model}}
\label{BBprob}

Whilst the above description of the standard Big Bang theory of cosmology had long been accepted,
it does not allow us to explain everything we observe in the universe. In this section I will highlight
some of these problems and explain how inflation may provide an answer. For a detailed overview of the 
problems of the Big Bang model and motivation for inflation we refer to Ref.~\cite{Liddle:2000cg}.
The main problems with the standard Big Bang model can be summarized as follows: 
\begin{itemize}
%
 \item \textbf{Flatness problem:} During the Big Bang since gravity is attractive $\dot{a}$ is necessarily decreasing. This means $\Omega - 1$ 
is increasing and that the universe is evolving away from flatness, see Eq.~(\ref{DensPar}). The latest {\sc Planck} results indicate that $\Omega$ is very close to 1, i.e.~the 
universe is close to being flat, see Eq.~(\ref{Omegak}). For this to be true in the Big Bang scenario, this requires that at early times the universe must have been extremely 
flat, for instance, at nucleosynthesis we would require that the density parameter differed from 1 by less than $10^{-16}$\cite{Liddle:2000cg}. 
This highly fine-tuned initial state is unlikely without some additional explanation.
%
 \item \textbf{Horizon problem:} The universe appears very smooth, different regions of the sky appear very homogeneous and 
in fact the temperature across the entire sky is uniform up to one part in $10^5$ \cite{Komatsu:2010fb, Hinshaw:2012aka, Ade:2013zuv}. 
However the observable universe today is much bigger than the particle horizon, which means it is made up of causally-disconnected patches.
Within the Big Bang model there is no physical reason for this homogeneity. For these patches to be so uniform again requires a high degree of fine tuning.
%
 \item \textbf{Relic problem:} The breaking of the symmetry of many unified theories in the early universe predicts an abundance of 
topological relics such as monopoles. However, none of the latter have yet been observed in our universe, 
something for which, again, there is no physical explanation of within the Big
Bang model. 
\end{itemize}
%
In addition,
\begin{itemize}
 \item \textbf{Structure problem:} There is no explanation in the Big Bang model as to how structure came to form in our universe, i.e.~where the initial fluctuations that
grew into galaxies today actually came from. Whilst this is not technically a problem with the Big Bang model it is something that would be required for a complete theory of 
the early universe. 
\end{itemize}


Inflation, which was proposed in the 1980's \cite{Guth:1980zm}, can provide a solution to all four of the above problems.
Inflation itself is the theory that early in its history the universe went through a period of rapid accelerated expansion,
\be
\ddot{a} > 0 \,.
\ee
There are three other equivalent definitions which allow for a more physical interpretation
\be
\frac{d}{dt} \left(\frac{1}{aH}\right) < 0  \,, \quad -\frac{\dot{H}}{H^2} < 1 \,, \quad \rho + 3P < 0\,.
\ee
The first inequality above is that inflation occurs whilst the comoving Hubble length ($1/aH$) is decreasing with respect to time,
the second is that the $H$ is changing slowly compared to the Hubble timescale and the third states that for inflation to occur
the pressure must be negative.

We can also define the number of e-folds of expansion that have occurred between times with scale factor equal to $a_{\rm{init}}$ and $a$ by
\be
\N \equiv \ln \frac{a}{a_{\rm{init}}} \,.
\label{efolds}
\ee
Note that as $\N$ increases monotonically with time (i.e.~the universe is always expanding) and therefore we can use $\N$ as an alternative time variable. 

This period of rapid expansion solves the problems with the Big Bang model in the following way:
%
\begin{itemize}
 \item \textbf{Flatness problem:} During inflation the scale factor of the universe is accelerating ($\ddot{a} > 0$) which means that during inflation 
the density parameter is driven towards 1, i.e.~the universe evolves towards flatness, see Eq.~(\ref{DensPar}). 
Including inflation means $\Omega$ no longer needs to be so finely tuned - as long as the period of inflation is long enough, we can 
drive $\Omega$ as close as we like to $1$.
% Add part about horizon scales and \Omega being the same on horizon exit as horizon entry 
% 
 \item \textbf{Horizon problem:} So long as the observable universe is inside the horizon at the start of inflation then the entire observable universe 
will have been in causal contact at some point in the early universe and therefore it is no longer surprising that there is homogeneity across the entire
universe that we can see. This notion of scales we observe now being inside the Horizon during inflation is studied in more detail in Section~\ref{Horizons}
%
 \item \textbf{Relic problem:} The rapid expansion and increase in volume that occurs during inflation will dilute the number density of 
these relics until they can be considered non-interacting.  
%
 \item \textbf{Structure problem:} It is possible during a period of inflation that the seeds for the structure we see today could
be generated by quantum fluctuations. This gives a natural way of sourcing the structure of the universe and is studied in more detail in Section~\ref{Quantum}.
\end{itemize}

While the theory of inflation has many positive aspects, it
 is also worth noting that inflation itself requires some fine tuning, for instance the small patch which will become our universe needs to be homogeneous and isotropic. 
We also require a minimum of about 60 e-folds of inflation in order to solve the flatness and horizon problems 
(the exact value depends on the details of inflation and reheating) \cite{Allahverdi:2010xz, Bassett:2005xm}.
Inflation is only a good solution to the fine tuning problems above if it does not itself need to be very finely tuned.



\subsection{Scalar field driven inflation}
\label{InflationEqu}

As mentioned above, the type of matter that drives inflation must have negative pressure and 
the simplest type to consider besides a cosmological constant is a scalar field. There are many possibilities here for both
single and multi-inflationary models and they can all be specified by considering their Lagrangian, which is a function of
the scalar field and the relativistic kinetic energy.
The simplest class of models and the one we will be concentrating on in this thesis is that of canonical single field inflation.
It's Lagrangian is given by,
\be
\mathcal{L} = \frac{1}{2}g^{\mu \nu} \vp_{,\mu} \vp_{,\nu} - U(\vp) \,, %Check this equation!!! 
\ee
where the first term is the relativistic kinetic energy and the second term, $U$, is the potential.
In such a single field model the scalar field is often referred to as the inflaton.


We can define the energy-momentum tensor of the scalar field using the Lagrangian \cite{Lyth:2009zz}
\be
T^{\mu \nu}= - 2 \frac{\partial \mathcal{L}}{\partial g_{\mu \nu}} + g^{\mu \nu} \mathcal{L} \,.
\ee 
Expanding this out gives us \cite{Weinberg:2008zzc}
\be
\label{Tscalar}
T_{\mu \nu} = \vp_{,\mu} \vp_{, \nu} - g_{\mu \nu} \left( \frac{1}{2} \vp_{,}\,^{\alpha} \vp_{,\alpha} + U(\vp) \right) \,,
\ee
which, when we consider a FLRW metric and a homogeneous scalar field, has the form of the energy-momentum tensor for a perfect fluid. 
Comparing to Eq.~(\ref{stressenergyPerfect}) we find that the background pressure and density are given by, 
\bea
\label{PressDensInfl}
\rho_0 &=& \frac{1}{2a^2} {\vp_0'}^2 + U(\vp) \,,\\
P_0 &=& \frac{1}{2a^2} {\vp_0'}^2 - U(\vp) \,.
\eea
We can see from the above equation that we will indeed have a negative pressure if the potential energy dominates
over the kinetic energy.

Either by varying the action, using the definition above for the Lagrangian or by directly substituting the
expressions for the density and pressure into the equation of motion for a perfect fluid we can determine the governing equations.
The continuity equation leads to the following background Klein-Gordon equation \cite{Liddle:2000cg},
%
 \be
 \label{KGback}
 \vp_0''+ 2 \H \vp_0'+ a^2 U_{,\vp}=0\,,
 \ee
and the Einstein field equations give the Friedmann equation
 \be
 \label{FriedmannPhi}
 \H^2 = \frac{8 \pi G }{3 }   \left(a^2 U_0  + \frac{1}{2}{\vp'_{0}}^2 \right)\,.
 \ee

This description still leads to a multitude of different models with different types of potentials, one of the simplest 
of which is the original chaotic inflation model. 
%\footnote{Note that this model is now on the limit of what is allowed observationally \cite{Ade:2013uln}.} 
It has the potential
\be
U(\varphi) = \frac{1}{2}m^2 \vp^2 \,.
\ee 
In Section~\ref{numerical} we will describe some other popular inflaton potentials.


\subsection{Slow Roll Approximation}

A useful simplification can be made if we assume almost exponential inflation, i.e.~$|\dot{H}| \ll H^2 $.
We define a slow roll parameter $\epsilon_{\rm{sr}}$ 
\be
\epsilon_{\rm{sr}} = \frac{\dot{\vp}^2}{4 H^2} = -\frac{\dot{H}}{H^2}  \,,
\label{srepsilon}
\ee
which leads to the following equation
\be
\frac{\ddot{a}}{a} = H^2 (1 - \epsilon_{\rm{sr}} ) \,,
\ee
and implies that we will have an inflationary period for as long as $\epsilon_{\rm{sr}} < 1$.
However in order for our inflationary period to last long enough we must introduce a second slow roll parameter,
\be
\eta_{\rm{sr}} = -\frac{\ddot{\vp}}{H \dot{\vp}} \,.
\label{sreta}
\ee
Here $\eta_{\rm{sr}}$ describes the flatness of the potential.
While $\eta_{\rm{sr}} < 1$ the change of $\dot{\vp}$ and therefore the change of $\epsilon_{\rm{sr}}$ is slow,
leading to an extended period of inflation.

Taking the slow roll approximation amounts to setting $\epsilon_{\rm{sr}} \ll 1$ and $\eta_{\rm{sr}} \ll 1$. 
This implies that the potential energy dominates over the kinetic energy and is 
equivalent to setting the first term in Eq.~(\ref{KGback}) and the last term in Eq.~(\ref{FriedmannPhi}) to zero.
This leads to the approximate governing equations
\bea
H^2 &\approx& \frac{1}{3} U(\vp) \,, \\
\dot{\vp} &\approx& - \frac{U_{,\vp}}{3H} \,,
\eea
and, as we mentioned at the start of this section, exponential expansion (i.e.~a quasi-de Sitter spacetime),
\be
a(t) \sim e^{Ht} \,.
\ee
 While the slow roll approximation holds, inflation will always occur and inflation will end when $\epsilon_{\rm{sr}} = 1$.



\section{Time line of events in the early universe}
\label{history}

We conclude this introductory section by giving an outline of the key events in the history of our universe.
In the table that follows we present the time, scale factor, red shift and energy of these key events 
\cite{Ade:2013zuv, Baumann:2009ds, Liddle:2000cg}, some of which are
only order of magnitude approximations, for the exact values of those needed in the thesis, see Appendix A.

\section{Notation}

To finish this chapter we will outline some of the notation conventions we will use throughout this thesis. 

\begin{itemize}
\item We use the positive metric signature throughout, (-+++).
\item We use natural units throughout unless specified (in particular in sections of Chapter 4 and Chapter 6 we work in SI units). 
 \item We will often use the Fourier component of a function, $f(k^i)$, which is related to the function in real space, $f (x^i)$, by
\be
f (\eta,x^i) = \frac{1}{(2\pi)^3} \int d^3 k f(\eta, k^i) e^{i k_i x^i} \, .
\ee
\item Differentiation with respect to coordinate time, $t$, will be denoted with an overdot ($\dot{}$), differentiation with respect to conformal time, $\eta$,
will be denoted by a prime ($'$) and differentiation with respect to the number of e-folds $\N$ will be denoted by a dagger, (${}^{\dagger}$). 
\item We will be using a comma to denote a partial derivative, $v_{,i} \equiv \frac{\partial}{\partial x^i} v$ and a semi colon to denote a covariant derivative,
$v_{\nu;\mu} \equiv \nabla_{\mu} v_{\nu} $.
\item Greek indices will take values $0$ through to $3$ and will cover the whole spacetime, where as latin indices will take the values $1$ through to $3$ and will 
cover the spacial slice. 
\item When dealing with perturbative expansions we will denote the order by a subscript, this will always be the number closest to the quantity, i.e.~
$\delta \rho_1$. In Chapter 4, where we consider multiple species, the species type will be indicated by a subscript in brackets.
For instance, the first order density perturbation for photons would be given by $\delta \rho_{1 (\gamma)}$. 
\item Background quantities will be denoted by a subscript 0, unless otherwise indicated at the start of a chapter, in particular
in Chapter 4 and 6 we will be dropping the subscript 0 and any quantity without a subscript should be considered a background quantity.    
\end{itemize}
