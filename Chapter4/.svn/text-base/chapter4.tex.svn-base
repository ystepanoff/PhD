\section{Inter-galactic magnetic fields}

In the next two chapters we will be looking at an application of second order perturbation theory, namely that of primordial magnetic fields. In this chapter we will review 
the background to this research area and derive the fully relativistic Maxwell equations to second order in perturbation theory. 

\subsection{Observations}

Magnetic fields have been observed in our universe on many scales, from local planetary scales through to intergalactic scales.
In fact every time we have been able to probe a new scale we have found magnetic fields there.
Magnetic fields were first seen on planetary scales and of course the existence of the Earth's magnetic field has been known
for many years. It was in 1962, however, that the first galactic magnetic field was observed, when radio polarization
was detected in the Milky Way by Westerhout et al. and Wielebinski et al., Ref.~\cite{Wielebinski}.
In the 60's and 70's with the ability
to use large radio telescopes, such as the Effelsberg radio telescope and the Very Large Array in New Mexico, the number of galaxies that were known to
contain magnetic fields grew and since then our knowledge of galactic magnetic fields has greatly improved.  
We know that they have typical coherence lengths of a few kpcs and have strengths of approximately a few $\mu G$
\cite{Widrow:2002ud,Kulsrud:2007an,Kronberg:1993vk,Carilli:2001hj, Fletcher:2011fn}. 
More recently, there have also been observations of magnetic fields, with similar strengths, in higher redshift galaxies\cite{Bernet:2008qp}. 
Following this it was found that magnetic fields are also present in the intra cluster medium between galaxies. 
In the last couple of decades similar strength magnetic fields (approximately $1 \mu G$) have been observed on galaxy cluster scales with coherence lengths 
of a few Mpcs \cite{Kim:1991zzc,Deiss:1996wk, Kronberg:2007dy, Bernet:2008qp,Wolfe:2008nk, Clarke:2000bz} 
and even in superclusters \cite{Xu:2005rb}.
However, we are interested here in a more recent discovery; within the last few years there have been 
observations showing the existence of inter-cluster magnetic fields in voids, far from any galaxies, with strengths ranging between 
$10^{-17} - 10^{-14} G$ (for details of these observations see for instance Refs.~\cite{Tavecchio:2010mk,Ando:2010rb,Neronov:1900zz,Tavecchio:2010ja,Essey:2010nd}.) 
Although at present not much is known about these large scale magnetic fields, there are exciting opportunities to learn more about
them in the coming years with large radio telescopes such as the Square Kilometre Array on the horizon \cite{Beck:2011gv}, the possibility
of using a cosmic shear survey such as Euclid \cite{Fedeli:2012rr} and polarization data also due from {\sc Planck} \cite{Shiraishi:2013vha}. %% Add something about Bicep?? 
In the chapters that follow we will be looking at the origin for these inter-galactic magnetic fields which are observed in voids and at higher redshifts.
For further information on the history of observed magnetic fields we refer to the reviews, Refs.~\cite{Han:2002ns, Kronberg:1994ae, Giovannini:2003yn}. 

\subsection{Astrophysical or cosmological origin?}


%%% Amplification
It is well known that the current observed magnetic fields might be explained by the amplification of small seed fields by either a 
dynamo mechanism \cite{Kulsrud:1996km, Kulsrud:2007an, Brandenburg:2004jv, Grasso:2000wj} or by adiabatic compression of a previously magnetised cloud \cite{King:2005xh, Grasso:2000wj},
or indeed both of these mechanisms simultaneously. 
Galactic dynamos are rotating galaxies containing a seed field. As the galaxy rotates, the field lines wind and 
rotational kinetic energy is turned into additional magnetic energy, thereby amplifying the magnetic field strength. 
Depending on the efficiency of the dynamo and the cosmological model it operates in, we would need a seed field of between $10^{-12}$G and $10^{-30}$G to satisfy observations
\cite{Kulsrud:2007an}.
The adiabatic compression of previously magnetised clouds works in a similar way, the difference being field lines are compressed
 turning gravitational potential energy into magnetic energy.
This mechanism is not quite as efficient as the dynamo mechanism so we would require a slightly stronger seed field of at least $10^{-20}$G\cite{King:2005xh, Grasso:2000wj}.
Galactic dynamos and adiabatic compression of magnetised clouds can explain galactic and possibly cluster magnetic fields.
However, it is difficult to use these to explain magnetic fields observed at high redshift, and even more so to explain intergalactic fields, since they
both require the presence of a galaxy, or a compressing cloud, to work. 
In addition, the question still remains as to where the seed magnetic fields originated from. There is no definite answer to this question, but much 
work has been done trying to understand its origin, see for instance the recent reviews, Refs.~\cite{Durrer:2013pga, Widrow:2011hs, Kandus:2010nw}.
 We outline some of the generation mechanisms below.


%% Origin of seed fields
The explanations for the seed field can be be split into two categories. Firstly, they could have been created post-recombination
from astrophysical processes, for instance, by battery-type effects during structure formation, such as Biermann-battery mechanism 
\cite{Giovannini:2003yn} or supernova batteries \cite{Hanayama:2005hd}. 
Secondly, the seed fields could be primordial and have a cosmological origin.
The astrophysical processes work on galactic scales and therefore at first it seems they could not source magnetic fields 
on cluster or intergalactic scales. However, magnetic fields on these scales may have been caused by 
 magnetized outflows from nearby galaxies, for instance galactic winds caused by star formation \cite{Bertone:2006mr} 
or relativistic outflows caused by Active Galactic Nuclei \cite{Ensslin:1996ep}. 
Whilst primordial origins may look more favorable, leading to inter-galactic magnetic fields (IGMFs) occurring even in voids and providing a clearer explanation
for the existence of these magnetic fields at higher redshift, they do have their own problems, since sustaining a magnetic field in the early
universe is difficult.
To study any primordial magnetic field it is best to look at the inter-galactic medium where the effects of amplification are at their lowest.
Distinguishing between the primordial and astrophysical origins will need more measurements of both the strength and the coherence length of the IGMF \cite{Durrer:2013pga}. 
However, if it were found that these magnetic fields were cosmological in origin and were formed before the formation of the CMB
and Big Bang Nucleosynthesis (BBN), this would open up the exciting possibility of using magnetic fields
as a new probe for fundamental physics and possibly even physics beyond the Standard Model. %% If phase transitions and inflation  
It is the cosmological origins of magnetic fields that we will be concentrating on here.


%%% What other observations must they satisfy
Besides the primordial field needing to be strong enough to act as a seed for the dynamo mechanisms, we also require the early universe magnetic field
to satisfy other observational constraints. Strong primordial magnetic fields have implications in the post-recombination universe which limits
the potential strength any such seed field can have.  
% For instance, magnetic fields can affect thermal and chemical evolution during the ``dark ages''. The dissipation of a small fraction of the magnetic field energy increases the 
% temperature and ionization fraction of the inter-galactic medium (IGM), which in turn enhances the ionization fraction leading to larger molecule abundances.
The main observational constraints are: Firstly, nucleosynthesis arguments lead to a maximum strength at the time of galaxy formation of $10^{-7} G$ \cite{Grasso:2000wj}.
Secondly, the lack of gravitational wave observations leads to a maximum strength of between  $10^{-9} G$ and $10^{-6} G$  depending on the scale of the super cluster
they are observed in \cite{Wang:2008vp}.
Thirdly, various CMB observables such as magnetised Sunyaev-Zeldovich effect, Faraday rotation and most importantly the CMB isotropy,
lead to a maximum present field strength of $10^{-9} G$  \cite{Barrow:1997mj}.
%Magnetic fields also effect the formation of the first stars through changing their mass scale due to the magnetic Jeans mass dominating over the thermal Jeans mass.
%Finally the magnetic fields would impact upon the epoch of reionisation and this effect on reionisation could be imprinted in 21cm signature and be detectable.
Finally, the constraints coming from ionization data give a maximum comoving field strength of $10^{-9} G$ \cite{Schleicher:2008aa}.
All of these observations lead to an upper limit on the strength of any primordial magnetic field observed today of the order of $10^{-9} G$.


\subsection{Possible cosmological origins}

The many explanations for the formation of primordial magnetic fields can be grouped into three main categories: inflation, phase transitions and second order
perturbations, which we will outline briefly below.
In addition to these three most popular classes of primordial magnetogenesis there are many other generation mechanisms which are possible. For instance magnetogenesis
can occur during reheating or during an earlier epoch due to more exotic physics such as string physics and extra dimensions.
For further details on all the generation mechanisms mentioned here see for instance Refs.~\cite{Durrer:2013pga, Kandus:2010nw, Giovannini:2003yn, Dolgov:2003xd} 
and the references therein.

Firstly, a seed magnetic field could be produced during inflation.
The basic premise here is that very long wavelength photons are generated from subhorizon quantum mechanical fluctuations during inflation. 
Then, at reheating, these electromagnetic waves
are converted to large scale magnetic fields when the currents present in the conductive plasma can cause the elimination of the electric part. 
There are however problems with this mechanism. In order to generate these inflationary
magnetic fields one must either couple the electromagnetic field to the inflaton, introduce a coupling that breaks conformal or gauge invariance, or both
or break conformal symmetry
\cite{Turner:1987bw, Ratra:1991bn, Martin:2007ue, Enqvist:2004yy}.
In order to produce magnetic fields strong enough to account for galactic and inter-galactic magnetic fields one has the choice
 to rely on a very blue spectrum of scalar inflaton fluctuation (which is in tension with current observations), 
to let the electron charge become very large at early times, or break gauge invariance. Obviously none of these scenarios is ideal.
Conventional magnetic fields in a flat FLRW metric are also diluted during inflation, by adiabatic magnetic decay and so are too weak (less than $10^{-50}G$ \cite{Turner:1987bw}) 
to seed and sustain a galactic dynamo.
However, there has been much work in this field in trying to come up with a model which will allow the appropriate magnetic field to be generated.
For more details see for instance Refs.~\cite{Kandus:2010nw, Jain:2012ga, Motta:2012rn, Kunze:2009bs}. 


Secondly, magnetic fields could be produced during phase transitions such as electroweak or QCD symmetry breaking.
If the phase transition is first order, bubble nucleation occurs. As the bubbles and horizons grow bubble walls collide and
 these collisions can produce magnetic fields \cite{Hogan:1983zz, Baym:1995fk, Enqvist:1991xw }. 
Whilst the magnetic fields produced can be strong, they often have small coherence lengths.
It has been shown though that with an inverse cascade occurring it might be possible to generate a magnetic field of up to $10^{-21} G$ \cite{Ahonen:1997wh}.
However in the Standard Model neither of these phase transitions are first order, so the above process would require going beyond the Standard Model.
If the phase transition is second order it is still possible to form magnetic fields, however, 
they have very small coherence lengths%, will destabilize the dynamo 
and will get damped away \cite{Vachaspati:1991nm, Davidson:1996rw, Grasso:1997nx}, therefore, 
we would only expect to generate magnetic fields with a magnitude of approximately $10^{-30} G$\cite{Vachaspati:1991nm}.
For more details on magnetic fields generated by phase transitions see for instance Refs.~\cite{Durrer:2013pga, Kandus:2010nw}.
%

Lastly, magnetic fields may have been created by second order perturbations between lepton decoupling and recombination.
This mechanism was first proposed by Harrison \cite{Harrison:1973zz}, 
who showed that if we have first order vector perturbations and if electrons and protons are not perfectly coupled, then the difference in the vorticity
between the two species can generate a magnetic field.
In standard inflation first order vectors are not present, assuming we are not able to directly source them 
by other means, such as topological defects, the only other way to have first order vectors would be to modify our theory of gravity. 
For instance, using a vector-tensor gravity such as Aether theory leads to magnetic fields with strength of approximately $10^{-22}G$ \cite{Saga:2013glg}. 
It is however possible to take this beyond first order and even with no first order vectors, 
at second order it is possible to generate a magnetic field, although as this is a second order result one would expect the 
strength of such a magnetic field to be small. 
There has been some work on this at second order both analytically 
\cite{Betschart:2003bn, Matarrese:2004kq, Gopal:2004ut, Ichiki:2006cd, Takahashi:2005nd, Maeda:2008dv, Kobayashi:2007wd}  
and numerically \cite{Ichiki:2007hu, Maeda:2011uq, Fenu:2010kh}. 
Whilst there is some disagreement between these papers none generate a magnetic field larger than $10^{-24} G$.  


There do, however, remain some interesting open questions in this field. 
In the following two chapters we will be looking at generating magnetic fields using second order perturbations in 
more detail from an analytic perspective.
We will present a more complete analytic calculation than has be done previously, as much of the previous 
work has concentrated on one or two specific terms rather than the full set of equations. In considering all terms we hope
to get a better match to the numerical calculations.   %% Is this true look at all past analytic work
We will also look at the scale dependence of the magnetic field and how this varies under different conditions and assumptions
and discuss how the result depends on the cut off scale that must be introduced in both analytic and numerical calculations.
% This last point is particularly important as the numerical calculations suggest that the strength of the magnetic field is 
% increasing on smaller scales so if it were possible to fully understand the smaller scale result we might find that the 
% result is enhanced. 
We will also be presenting an analytic set up that allows us to analyse the difference between the different tight coupling
scenarios, what effect that has on the magnetic field produced and
what difference it makes if we have non-adiabatic pressure present. In particular, we will look at how the result differs depending on where the non-adiabatic 
pressure comes from, whether that be isocurvature which is introduced during inflation or non-adiabatic pressure due to a multi-species plasma. 



\section{Relativistic Maxwell Equations}

The study of the interaction between plasmas and electromagnetic fields is vast and has many obvious
applications. However, if we are to study primordial magnetogenesis in the early universe then we need
to also take General Relativity into account. 
We will need both a relativistic theory of electromagnetism and a formalism for the study of multi-fluid 
charged systems. As we are interested in magnetogenesis brought about by second order perturbations, both
these formalisms will need to be set in cosmological perturbation theory beyond linear order. 
Multi-fluid charged systems were discussed in detail in Chapter~\ref{multifluid} where we derived the multi-species energy and
momentum equations for a multi-fluid system comprising of electrons, protons, photons and a background electric field.
 We use the gauge-invariant 
formalism of Bardeen, which is covered in detail in Chapter~\ref{CPT}, but there has also been much work 
using the covariant approach to relativistic cosmological perturbations,
for instance see Ref.~\cite{Marklund:2002uz}.
We will start by reviewing some of the geometrical quantities we will need and then proceed to review
 the equations which govern the evolution of electromagnetic fields. Finally, we will 
derive a self-consistent fully relativistic set of Maxwell Equations, expanded up to second order.

\subsection{Geometrical Quantities}
\label{geometric}


We will need to decompose the Maxwell equations below with respect to $u_{\mu}$, the observer's 4-velocity, so that the equations are in a form we can solve perturbatively.
With this in mind we consider some geometrical quantities we will need first.
The 4-velocity was defined in Eq.~(\ref{4Veldef}) and Eq.~(\ref{4Vel}) and its covariant derivative can be decomposed as follows \cite{Malik:2008im},
\be
u_{\mu;\nu} = \sigma_{\mu\nu} + \omega_{\mu\nu} + \frac{1}{3}\theta h_{\mu\nu} - \dot{u_{\mu}}u_{\nu} \,, \label{decu}
\ee
where $\dot{u_{\mu}} = u_{\mu;\nu}u^{\nu}$ and $\dot{u_{\mu}}u_{\mu} = 0$. 
$\omega_{\mu \nu}$ is the vorticity and is an antisymmetric tensor,
$\sigma_{\mu\nu}$ is the shear and is a symmetric and trace free tensor, $\theta$ is the expansion rate
and $h_{\mu \nu}$ is the symmetric spatial projection tensor.
Taking each of these geometrical quantities we can define them in terms of the 4-velocity and therefore write them 
in terms of the metric perturbations.
The projection tensor is defined as,
\be
h_{\mu\nu} = g_{\mu\nu} + u_{\mu}u_{\nu} \,,
\ee
where $h_{\mu\nu}u^{\nu} = 0$, $h^{\mu}_{\mu} = 3$ and $h^{\mu}_{\nu} h^{\nu}_{\lambda} = h^{\mu}_{\lambda}$.
The expansion rate in terms of the 4-velocity is
\be
\theta = u^{\mu}_{;\mu} \,.
\ee
Expanding the expansion rate order by order in a series expansion we can write down the background and first order
expressions in terms of the metric perturbations \cite{Malik:2008im},
\bea
\label{theta}
\theta_0 &=& \frac{3}{a} \H \, \\
\theta_1 &=& -\frac{3}{a} \left[ \H \phi_1 + \psi_1' - \frac{1}{3} \nabla^2 \sigma_1 \right] \,,
\eea
where $\sigma_1$ is the scalar shear and is defined to be $\sigma_1 \equiv E_1' - B_1$.

The shear in terms of the 4-velocity is 
\be
\sigma_{\mu \nu} = \frac{1}{2} h_{\mu}^{\alpha} h_{\nu}^{\beta} (u_{\alpha;\beta} + u_{\beta;\alpha}) - \frac{1}{3} \theta h_{\mu \nu} \,.
\ee
Expanding the shear order by order noting that by definition of the FLRW spacetime, the shear is zero in the background, 
we can write down the first order expressions again in terms of the metric perturbations \cite{Malik:2008im},
\bea
{\sigma_{1}}_{00} &=& 0 \,, \quad   {\sigma_{1}}_{0i} =0 \,, \\
{\sigma_{1}}_{ij} &=& a (\partial_i \partial_j - \frac{1}{3} \delta_{ij} \nabla^2) \sigma_1  + a ({F_1}'_{(i,j)} - {B_1}_{(i,j)}) + \frac{a}{2}  {h_1}'_{ij} \,.
\label{shear}
\eea

Finally the vorticity in terms of the 4-velocity is
\be
\omega_{\mu \nu} = \frac{1}{2} h_{\mu}^{\alpha} h_{\nu}^{\beta} (u_{\alpha;\beta} - u_{\beta;\alpha}) \,.
\ee
Again expanding the vorticity order by order and noting that by definition in FLRW spacetime the vorticity is zero in the background, the first order
expression in terms of the metric perturbations is,
\bea
{\omega_{1}}_{00} &=& 0 \,, \quad {\omega_{1}}_{0i} = 0 \,, \\
{\omega_{1}}_{ij} &=& \frac{1}{2} ( {V_1}_{i,j} - {V_1}_{i,j}) \,,
\label{vorticity}
\eea
where $V_1 = v_1 + B_1$.


We can change between the vector and tensor definitions of the vorticity $\omega$ using the following relationships.
\be
{\omega}^{\mu} = \frac{1}{2} \epsilon ^{\mu\nu\lambda\gamma} u_{\nu} \omega_{\lambda\gamma} , \quad {\omega}_{\mu\nu} = \epsilon_{\mu\nu\lambda\gamma} {\omega}^{\lambda} u^{\gamma} \,.
\ee



\subsection{Maxwell equations}

The main component of the Maxwell equations is the Faraday tensor, which in an inertial frame is defined by 
\be
F_{\mu \nu} = A_{\nu ,\mu} - A_{\mu ,\nu} \,,
\ee
 where $A_{\mu}$ is the 4-potential, given by 
 \be
 A_{\mu} = ( - \phi, \mathbf{A} ) \,,
 \ee
 and $\phi$ is the scalar electromagnetic potential and $\mathbf{A}$ is the vector electromagnetic potential. 
The electric (${\Et}_{\mu}$)  and magnetic (${\Mt}_{\mu}$) fields are defined in terms of these potentials,
 \be
 \Mt_{\mu} = \epsilon_{\mu \nu \lambda} A^{\lambda , \nu}  ,\quad  \Et_{\mu} = - \phi_{,\mu} - \dot{A_{\mu}}  \,.
 \ee
 The electric and magnetic fields measured by a comoving observer with 4-velocity $u^{\mu}$ can be described using the Faraday tensor, %\cite{} %[CITE: Iain 68,71,72]
 \be
\Et^{\mu} = F^{\mu \nu}u_{\nu} ,\quad \Mt^{\lambda} = \frac{1}{2} \epsilon^{\mu \nu \lambda} F_{\mu \nu} = \frac{1}{2} \epsilon^{\mu\nu\lambda\delta}u_{\nu} F_{\mu\delta} \,, 
\label{EMdef}
 \ee
 where
 \be
\label{E0M0}
 \Et_{\mu}u^{\mu} = 0, \quad \Mt_{\mu}u^{\mu} = 0 \,.
 \ee
Finally, the evolution of these magnetic and electric fields is described by Maxwell's equations,
\be
F_{[\mu\nu ; \lambda]} = 0  ,\quad { F^{\mu\nu}}_{;\nu} = \mu_0 j^{\mu} \,,
\ee
\noindent where $j^{\mu} = a^{-1}(\hat{\rho}, \mathbf{j}) $ is the four-current that sources the electromagnetic field, $\hat{\rho}$ is the comoving charge density,
$\mathbf{j}$ is the comoving charge current density and $\mu_0$ is the magnetic constant (or vacuum permeability), the value of which is given in Appendix A. 
This four-current can be decomposed as follows
\be
{\hat{\rho}} = -j^{\mu}u_{\mu}, \quad  \J^{\mu} = {h^{\mu}}_{\nu} j^{\nu} \,. 
\ee
where $\J^{\mu}$ is the projected four-current, orthogonal to the 4-velocity.

By projecting the Maxwell equations along and orthogonal to the 4-velocity vector, multiplying by $u_{\mu}$ and $h^{\mu}_{\nu}$ respectively, 
we can decompose Maxwell's equations with respect to $u_{\mu}$. We present the full details of this projection in Appendix C,
and we arrive at the following set of four covariant Maxwell equations, 
\bea
\label{Maxwell1}
{\Et^{\mu}}_{,\mu} + \Gamma^{\mu}_{k\mu} \Et^k - \dot{u_{\mu}}\Et^{\mu} &=& \hat{\rho} - 2\omega^{\mu} \Mt_{\mu} \,, \nonumber \\
{\Mt^{\mu}}_{,\mu} + \Gamma^{\mu}_{k\mu} \Mt^k - \dot{u_{\mu}}\Mt^{\mu} &=& - \omega^{\mu} \Et_{\mu} \,,
\eea
and
\bea
\dot{\Et}^{\lambda\perp} &=& (\omega^{\lambda}_{\nu} + \sigma^{\lambda}_{\nu} - \frac{2}{3} \theta h^{\lambda}_{\nu})\Et^{\nu} + \epsilon^{\lambda\nu\mu}\dot{u}_{\nu}\Mt_{\mu}
- \epsilon^{\lambda\nu\mu}(\Mt_{\nu,\mu}-\Gamma^k_{\nu\mu}\Mt_k) - \J^{\lambda} \,, \nonumber \\
\dot{\Mt}^{\lambda\perp} &=& (\omega^{\lambda}_{\nu} + \sigma^{\lambda}_{\nu} - \frac{2}{3} \theta h^{\lambda}_{\nu})\Mt^{\nu} - \epsilon^{\lambda\nu\mu}\dot{u}_{\nu}\Et_{\mu}
+ \epsilon^{\lambda\nu\mu}(\Et_{\nu,\mu}-\Gamma^k_{\nu\mu}\Et_k) \,,
\label{Maxwell2}
\eea
where ${\Et}^{\lambda\perp}$ and ${\Mt}^{\lambda\perp}$ are the projected electric and magnetic field respectively, both orthogonal to the 4-velocity.

Alternatively, the third and fourth equation above can be written as:
\bea
h^{\lambda}_{\mu}u^{\alpha}{\Et}^{\mu}_{,\alpha} &=& -(u^{\lambda} u_{\mu} {\Gamma}^{\mu}_{k \alpha} - {\Gamma}^{\lambda}_{k \alpha}) u^{\alpha} \Et^{k} + (\omega^{\lambda}_{\nu} + 
\sigma^{\lambda}_{\nu} - \frac{2}{3} \theta h^{\lambda}_{\nu})\Et^{\nu} + \epsilon^{\lambda\nu\mu}\dot{u}_{\nu}\Mt_{\mu} \nonumber \\
& &- \epsilon^{\lambda\nu\mu}(\Mt_{\nu,\mu}-\Gamma^k_{\nu\mu}\Mt_k) - \J^{\lambda}  \,, \\
h^{\lambda}_{\mu}u^{\alpha}{\Mt}^{\mu}_{,\alpha} &=& -(u^{\lambda} u_{\mu} {\Gamma}^{\mu}_{k \alpha} - {\Gamma}^{\lambda}_{k \alpha}) u^{\alpha} \Mt^{k} + (\omega^{\lambda}_{\nu} + 
\sigma^{\lambda}_{\nu} - \frac{2}{3} \theta h^{\lambda}_{\nu})\Mt^{\nu} - \epsilon^{\lambda\nu\mu}\dot{u}_{\nu}\Et_{\mu}  \nonumber \\
& &+ \epsilon^{\lambda\nu\mu}(\Et_{\nu,\mu}-\Gamma^k_{\nu\mu}\Et_k) \,.
\eea

Recalling that we are interested in the second order Maxwell equations we now expand out the Maxwell equations given in Eq.~(\ref{Maxwell1}) and Eq.~(\ref{Maxwell2}).
We start by expanding our electric and magnetic components out in a power series as we did with the density in Eq.~(\ref{expand}),
\bea
 \Mt &=& \MI + \frac{1}{2}\MII + \frac{1}{6}\MIII + ...  \,, \\
 \Et &=& \EI + \frac{1}{2}\EII + \frac{1}{6}\EIII + ... \,, \\
\hat{\rho} &=& \hat{\rho_0} + \hat{\rho_1} + \frac{1}{2}\hat{\rho_2} + \frac{1}{6}\hat{\rho_3} + ...  \,, 
\eea
and similarly for the expansion rate, vorticity and shear.
We have set the background electric and magnetic fields to zero in the equations above to satisfy observational constraints on the isotropy of the CMB. %%reference here

We use CPT, as described in Chapter~\ref{CPT} in order to solve the magnetic field evolution equations order by order.
Substituting for the connection terms, (given in Appendix B) into Eq.~(\ref{Maxwell1}) to Eq.~(\ref{Maxwell2}) above and expanding the components to second order we 
obtain a set of evolution and constraint equations for the magnetic and electric fields. 
We have used the algebraic computer package Cadabra\cite{Peeters:2007wn} to assist in simplifying these perturbed equations. 
We will eliminate the temporal component of the magnetic and electric field by recalling that 
for a general observer  with a 4-velocity given by Eq.~(\ref{4Vel}) the time and space components of the magnetic and electric field are related by
Eq.~(\ref{E0M0}).
Expanding these relations order by order it can be shown that the first order temporal components are zero and the second order
components satisfy the following constraints, 
\bea
\MII_0 &=& -2\MI_i {v_1}^i \,, \\ 
%\MIII_0 &=& - 6\MI_i {v_1}^i \phi_1 - 3\MII_i {v_1}^i - 3\MI_i {v_2}^i \,, \\ \nonumber
\EII_0 &=& -2\EI_i {v_1}^i \,.
%\EIII_0 &=& - 6\EI_i {v_1}^i \phi_1 - 3\EII_i {v_1}^i - 3\EI_i {v_2}^i \,. 
\label{timeelim}
\eea

We will also be eliminating the expansion rates in terms of metric components using the expressions
given in Eq.~(\ref{theta}).




\subsection{First order Maxwell Equations}
\label{Maxwell1stOrder}

The first order Maxwell equations are gauge independent and are given by,
\be
{{\MI}^{i}\,_{,i}} = 0 \,,
\ee
\be
{{\EI}^{i}\,_{,i}} =  \mu_0 \hat{\rho}_1 \,,
\ee
\be
 {{\MI}^{i}}' + 2\H{\MI}^{i} = - a^2 {\epsilon}^{0 i j k} {{\EI}_{k,j}}  \,,
\label{MagEvo1}
\ee
\be
 {{\EI}^{i}}' + 2 \H {\EI}^{i} =  a^2 {\epsilon}^{0 i j k}{{\MI}_{k,j}} -  a \mu_0 {\J_1}^{i} \,.
\ee

If we assume standard inflation then there are no first order vector perturbations sourced during inflation,
and any that did exist would rapidly decay.  %%%Reference here?
Using the fact (see Section~\ref{ScVeTe}) that any first order vector quantity can be decomposed into
the gradient of a scalar and a divergence-free vector part, we now assume that the divergence-free 
vector parts of these expressions are zero. 
For instance, the first order electric field can be written as,
\be
{\EI}_{i} = {\EI}_{i}^{\rm{vec}} + {\EI}_{,i} = {\EI}_{,i} \,.
\ee
This allows us to write all our first order equations in terms of scalars rather than vectors,
\be
\nabla^2 {\MI} = 0 \,,
\ee
\be
\nabla^2 {\EI} =  \mu_0 \hat{\rho}_1 \,,
\ee
\be
 {{\MI}_{,}\,^i}' + 2\H{\MI}_{,}\,^i = - a^2 {\epsilon}^{0 i j k} {{\EI}_{, k j}} = 0 \,,
\label{MagEvo1}
\ee
\be
 {{\EI}_{,}\,^i}' + 2 \H {\EI}_{,}\,^i =  a^2 {\epsilon}^{0 i j k}{{\MI}_{, k j }} -  a \mu_0 {\J_1}_{,}\,^i = -  a \mu_0 {\J_1}_{,}\,^i \,.

We have used the fact that taking the curl of a gradient of a scalar i.e.~${\epsilon}^{0 i j k} {{\EI}_{, k j}}$ will always
be zero. This leads us to conclude that at first order the magnetic evolution equation has no source term, as we would expect.
In order to proceed we must move to second order. 


\subsection{Second Order Maxwell Equations}

Here we present the equations derived using Cadabra\cite{Peeters:2007wn}
for the second order Maxwell equations. We have kept these equations as general as possible,
making no assumptions other than a FLRW background and not yet specifying a gauge. 

The constraint equations are given by,
\bea
 {{\MII}^{i}\,_{,i}} &=&
- 2(E_{,ji}\,^j - 3\psi_{,i} +  2 \H {v_1}_{i} + 2{\phi_{1,i}} - {{B_1}_{,i}}' + {{S_1}_{i}}'- 2 {v_1}_{i}' ) {\MI}^{i} \nonumber \\
& &- 2 a^2 {\epsilon}^{0 i j k} {v_1}_{i}{{\EI}_{k,j}} + 2{\omega_1}^{i} {\EI}_i \,, \\
 {{\EII}^{i}\,_{,i}}  &=&  
- 2(E_{,ji}\,^j - 3\psi_{,i} + 2{\phi_{1,i}} - 2{{v_1}_{i}}'  - {{B_1}_{,i}}' + {{S_1}_{i}}'   + 2 \H{v_1}_{i} ) {\EI}^{i} \nonumber \\

\eea
and the evolution equations by,
\bea

\eea

Note that here we do have a source term for the second order Maxwell evolution equation. Again this 
is as we would expect and there is much work in the literature based on trying to evaluate and explain
this source term, see for instance Refs.~\cite{ Maeda:2011uq, Fenu:2010kh, Ichiki:2007hu, Maeda:2008dv}. 
In Chapter~\ref{MagPS} we will be looking at this source term in more
detail.
In order to make our equations more useful for analytic and numeric calculations we will now present them in two different gauges.
For more information about picking gauges and gauge choices see Section~\ref{gauge}.

\subsubsection{Maxwell equations in flat gauge}

First we write down the second order Maxwell equations in flat gauge (see Section~\ref{flat}). 
This is the gauge that we use in Chapter~\ref{MagPS} where we study the 
second order source term. It is a convenient gauge for analytic work. 

The constraint equations in flat gauge are given by,
\bea
 {{\MII}^{i}\,_{,i}} &=&
- 2(2 \H {v_1}_{i} + 2{\phi_{1,i}} - {{B_1}_{,i}}' + {{S_1}_{i}}'- 2 {v_1}_{i}' ) {\MI}^{i} + 2{\omega_1}^{i} {\EI}_i  \nonumber \\
& &- 2 a^2 {\epsilon}^{0 i j k} {v_1}_{i}{{\EI}_{k,j}} \,, \label{Mcon2}\\
 {{\EII}^{i}\,_{,i}}  &=&  
- 2( 2{\phi_{1,i}} - 2{{v_1}_{i}}'  - {{B_1}_{,i}}' + {{S_1}_{i}}'   + 2 \H{v_1}_{i} ) {\EI}^{i} - 4 {\omega_1}^{i} {\MI}_{i}\nonumber \\
 & &+ 2 a^2 {v_1}_{i}{\epsilon}^{0 i j k} {{\MI}_{k,j}}  + \mu_0 \hat{\rho}_2  - 2 a   \mu_0 {v_1}_{i}{\J_1}^{i} \,,\label{Econ2}
\eea
and the evolution equations are,
\bea
 {{\MII}^{i}}' &+& 2\H{\MII}^{i} \nonumber \\
&=&
( {{S_1}_{j,}\,^i} - {{S_1}^{i}\,_{,j}}  + {h_{1j}\,^i}' + 2a({\omega_1}^{i}\,_{j} + {\sigma_1}^{i}\,_{j}) ){\MI}^{j} \nonumber \\
& &- \frac{4}{3}  {{v_1}^{j}\,_{,j}} {\MI}^{i} - 2 {v_1}^{j}{{\MI}^{i}\,_{,j}} 
-  2 a^4  ( {v_1}^{j}+{B_{1,}}^{j} - {S_1}^{j})({{\MI}_{j,}\,^{i}} -  {{\MI}^{i}\,{,j}}) \nonumber \\
& & - 2 a^2{\epsilon}^{0 i j k} 
( ({{v_1}_{j}}' + {{B_1}_{,j}}' - {{S_1}_{j}}' - {\phi_{1,j}}  - 2\H({v_1}_{j}+{B_1}_{,j}) + 2\H{S_1}_{j}) {\EI}_{k} 
 \nonumber \\
& &+ \frac{1}{2} {{\EII}_{k,j}}- \frac{1}{2}h_{1jk,l} {\EI}^{l} + 2\phi_1 {{\EI}_{k,j}} - {v_1}_{j} a \mu_0 {\J_1}_{k}- {B_1}_{,j} a \mu_0 {\J_1}_{k} +  {S_1}_{j} a \mu_0 {\J_1}_{k})\,, \nonumber \\
& & \label{Mevo2} \\
 {{\EII}^{i}} ' &+&  2\H {\EII}^{i} \nonumber \\
&=&
( {{S_1}_{j,}\,^{i}} - {{S_1}^{i}\,_{,j}}  
+ {h_{1j}\,^i}' + 2a({\omega_1}^{i}\,_{j} + {\sigma_1}^{i}\,_{j} )) {\EI}^{j}  \nonumber \\
& & - 2{v_1}^{j}{{\EI}^{i}\,_{,j}}  - 2 a^4 ({v_1}^{j} + {B_{1,}}^{j} - {S_1}^{j})({{\EI}_{j,}\,^{i}} - {{\EI}^{i}\,_{,j}}) 
- \frac{4}{3} {{v_1}^{j}\,_{,j}} {\EI}^{i} \nonumber \\
& &  + 2  a^2 {\epsilon}^{0 i j k} ( ({{v_1}_{j}}'  + {{B_1}_{,j}}' -  {{S_1}_{j}}' -  {\phi_{1,j}} - 2\H({v_1}_{j} + {B_1}_{,j} - {S_1}_{j}) ) {\MI}_{k} \nonumber \\
& & +  \frac{1}{2}{\partial}_{j}{{\MII}_{k}} 
-   \frac{1}{2}h_{1jk,l} {\MI}^{l} + 2  \phi_1 {{\MI}_{k , j}} )
 -  \mu_0 {\J_2}^{i} - 2\phi_1 a \mu_0 {\J_1}^{i} \,. \nonumber \\
& & \label{Eevo2}
\eea


\subsubsection{Maxwell equations in Newtonian Gauge}

We also write down our equations in Newtonian gauge (see Section~\ref{Newt}). 
This is a particularly useful gauge to present equations in as it
 is the gauge used for many of the Boltzmann codes which are needed to 
evaluate magnetic field numerically, see for instance \cite{Pettinari:2013he}.

The constraint equations in Newtonian gauge are given by,
\bea
 {{\MII}^{i}\,_{,i}} &=& - 2( - 3\psi_{,i} +  2 \H {v_1}_{i} + 2{\phi_{1,i}} - 2 {v_1}_{i}' ) {\MI}^{i} + 2 {\omega_1}^{i} {\EI}_i \nonumber \\
& &- 2 a^2 {\epsilon}^{0 i j k} {v_1}_{i}{{\EI}_{k,j}}  \,, \label{MEnewt1} \\
 {{\EII}^{i}\,_{,i}} & &   - 2( - 3\psi_{,i} + 2{\phi_{1,i}} - 2{{v_1}_{i}}'   + 2 \H{v_1}_{i} ) {\EI}^{i} - 4 {\omega_1}^{i} {\MI}_{i} \nonumber \\
& &+  2 a^2 {v_1}_{i}{\epsilon}^{0 i j k} {{\MI}_{k,j}} +  \mu_0 \hat{\rho}_2 - 2 a  \mu_0 {v_1}_{i}{\J_1}^{i} \,, \label{MEnewt2}
\eea
and the evolution equations, by,
\bea
 {{\MII}^{i}}' &+& 2\H{\MII}^{i} \nonumber \\
&=&
( 2{F_{1(j,}\,^{i)}}' + {h_{1j}\,^i}' + 2a({\omega_1}^{i}\,_{j} + {\sigma_1}^{i}\,_{j}) ){\MI}^{j} 
- \frac{2}{3} (2 {{v_1}^{j}\,_{,j}} - 3\psi_1') {\MI}^{i}  \nonumber \\
& & - 2 {v_1}^{j}{{\MI}^{i}\,_{,j}}  -  2 a^4 {v_1}^{j}({{\MI}_{j,}\,^{i}} -  {{\MI}^{i}\,{,j}}) - 2 a^2{\epsilon}^{0 i j k} 
( \frac{1}{2} {{\EII}_{k,j}}  + 2\phi_1 {{\EI}_{k,j}}\nonumber \\
& &+ ({{v_1}_{j}}'- 2\H{v_1}_{j} - {\phi_{1,j}} ) {\EI}_{k} - ( F_{1(j,k)l} + \frac{1}{2}h_{1jk,l}) {\EI}^{l}  -  {v_1}_{j} a \mu_0 {\J_1}_{k}) \,, \label{MEnewt3} \\
 {{\EII}^{i}} ' &+&  2\H {\EII}^{i} \nonumber \\
&=&
( 2{F_{1(j,}\,^{i)}}' + {h_{1j}\,^i}' + 2a({\omega_1}^{i}\,_{j} + {\sigma_1}^{i}\,_{j} )) {\EI}^{j}  
- 2{v_1}^{j}{{\EI}^{i}\,_{,j}}  - 2 a^4 {v_1}^{j} ({{\EI}_{j,}\,^{i}} - {{\EI}^{i}\,_{,j}}) \nonumber \\
& & - \frac{2}{3} (2{{v_1}^{j}\,_{,j}} - 3\psi_1') {\EI}^{i} 
 + 2  a^2 {\epsilon}^{0 i j k} ( ({{v_1}_{j}}' -  {\phi_{1,j}} - 2\H({v_1}_{j}  ) {\MI}_{k} 
 +  \frac{1}{2}{\partial}_{j}{{\MII}_{k}} \nonumber \\
& & -  (  F_{1(j,k)l} + \frac{1}{2}h_{1jk,l}) {\MI}^{l} + 2  \phi_1 {{\MI}_{k , j}} )
 -  \mu_0 {\J_2}^{i} - 2\phi_1 a \mu_0 {\J_1}^{i} \,. \label{MEnewt4}

\section{Gauge dependence}

In this chapter we have combined electromagnetism with CPT.
We can now consider the gauge dependence of the magnetic and electric fields by studying how the Faraday tensor transforms.

Splitting the Faraday tensor order by order we have,
%
\be
F_{\mu\nu}=F_{0\mu\nu}+F_{1\mu\nu}+\frac{1}{2}F_{2\mu\nu} + \ldots \,.
\ee
%
where the isotropy of the FLRW metric requires that $F_{0\mu\nu}\equiv 0$. 
By considering the transformation law for a 2-tensor, which we gave in Eq.~(\ref{tensortransform}), 
at first order the Faraday tensor transforms as,
%
\be
\widetilde{F_{1\mu\nu}}=F_{1\mu\nu}\,.
\ee
%
That is, in the
absence of the zeroth order quantity the Faraday tensor is gauge-invariant at first order, (this is known as the Stewart-Walker
Lemma).

As introduced in Section~\ref{activepassive} we can give the second order transformation
law for a 2-tensor \cite{Malik:2008im},
\bea
\widetilde{\delta T_{2 \mu \nu}} &=& \delta T_{2 \mu \nu} + 
+ T_{\mu \nu, ~\lambda}\xi^{\lambda}_{2} + T_{\lambda \nu} \xi^{\lambda}_{2,\mu} + T_{\mu \lambda} \xi^{\lambda}_{2,\nu} 
+ 2 \left[ \delta T_{\mu \nu, ~\lambda}\xi^{\lambda}_{1} + \delta T_{\lambda \nu} \xi^{\lambda}_{1,\mu} + \delta T_{\mu \lambda} \xi^{\lambda}_{1,\nu}   \right] \nonumber \\ 
& & + T_{\mu \nu, ~\lambda \alpha}\xi^{\lambda}_{1}\xi^{\alpha}_{1}  + T_{\mu \nu, ~\lambda}{\xi^{\lambda}_{1}}_{,\alpha} \xi^{\alpha}_{1}
+ 2 \left[ T_{\mu \lambda, ~\alpha}\xi^{\alpha}_{1} {\xi^{\lambda}_{1}}_{,\nu}  + T_{ \lambda \nu, ~\alpha}\xi^{\alpha}_{1} {\xi^{\lambda}_{1}}_{,\mu} 
+ T_{ \lambda \alpha} {\xi^{\lambda}_{1}}_{,\mu} {\xi^{\alpha}_{1}}_{,\nu}   \right] \nonumber \\
& & + T_{\mu \lambda} \left( {\xi^{\lambda}_{1}}_{,\nu \alpha} \xi^{\alpha}_{1} + {\xi^{\lambda}_{1}}_{,\alpha}{\xi^{\alpha}_{1}}_{,\nu }\right)
+ T_{ \lambda \nu} \left( {\xi^{\lambda}_{1}}_{,\mu \alpha} \xi^{\alpha}_{1} + {\xi^{\lambda}_{1}}_{,\alpha}{\xi^{\alpha}_{1}}_{,\mu }\right) \,.
\eea
It is clear that as the Faraday tensor is zero in the background, the above expression will simplify greatly
and the second order transformation will only depend on the first order gauge generator, $\xi^i$,
%
\be
\widetilde{F_{2\mu\nu}}=F_{2\mu\nu}+2\Bigg[
F_{1\mu\nu,\lambda}\xi^\lambda_1
+ F_{1\mu\lambda}\xi^\lambda_{1,~\nu} 
+ F_{1\lambda\nu}\xi^\lambda_{1,~\mu}
\Bigg]\,.
\ee
%
Thus, at second order the Faraday tensor is gauge dependent. 
% In flat gauge this becomes, 
% %
% \be
% \widetilde{F_{(2)\mu\nu}}=F_{(2)\mu\nu}+2\Bigg[
% F_{(1)\mu\nu}' \alpha_1 + F_{(1)\mu\nu,~i}\beta_{1,}\,^i + F_{(1)\mu\nu,~i}\gamma^i_1
% + F_{(1)\mu 0}\alpha_{1,~\nu} + F_{(1)\mu i}\beta_{1,~\nu}\,^i + F_{(1)\mu i}\gamma^i\,_{1,~\nu} 
% + F_{(1) 0 \nu}\alpha_{1,~\mu} + F_{(1) i \nu}\beta_{1,~\mu}\,^i + F_{(1) i \nu}\gamma^i\,_{1,~\mu} 
% \Bigg]\,,
% \ee
%

The magnetic and electric fields inherit the gauge dependence of the
Faraday tensor. For example, the magnetic field at linear order is
gauge-invariant,
%
\be
\widetilde{\MI_\mu} =\MI_\mu\,,
\ee
%
but at second order transforms as
%
\be
\widetilde{\MII_\mu} =\MII_\mu
+ 2 \left(\MI_{\mu,\lambda}\xi^\lambda_1 +\MI_{\lambda}\xi^\lambda_{1,~\mu}\right)
\,,
\ee
% If we write this expression out explicitly 
% \be
% \widetilde{\MII_\mu} =\MII_\mu
% + 2 \left(\MI_{\mu}' \alpha_1 + \MI_{\mu,i}\beta_{1,}\,^i + \MI_{\mu,i}\gamma^i_1
%  +\MI_{i}\beta_{1,~\mu}\,^i  +\MI_{i}\gamma^i_{1,~\mu}\right)
% \,.
% \ee
which, if we use the expressions given in Section~\ref{flat}, in flat gauge becomes,
\be
\widetilde{\MII_\mu} =\MII_\mu
+ 2 \left(\MI_{\mu}'\frac{\psi} {\H} - \MI_{\mu,i} E_{1,}\,^i - \MI_{\mu,i} F^i_1 - \MI_{i}E_{1,~\mu}\,^i  - \MI_{i}F^i_{1,~\mu}\right)
\,.
\ee
